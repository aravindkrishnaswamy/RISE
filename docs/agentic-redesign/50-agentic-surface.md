# Facet 5 — Agentic Surface & Product

> **Status:** design-in-progress. One of six parallel facet docs under
> [00-CHARTER.md](00-CHARTER.md). **Design only — no source, build, or scene changes.**
> **Updated per [`01-DECISIONS.md`](01-DECISIONS.md) (rounds 1–6, D1–D51):** added external-file
> conflict handling (atomic save + content-hash fingerprint, D6/D17); v7 is single-file (D7);
> the read/patch contracts expose the coherent version surface with **full
> `DerivedStamp`/`PreparedStamp`** rather than a single `derivedVersion`, and staleness is
> **cstVersion DAG ancestry, not numeric `<`** (D13/D29); the status surface now exposes
> **`requested*` AND `published*` stamps** and `status:ok` means **full-stamp equality**
> (published == requested on every axis — **refined by round-6 D49 to also require `phase==complete`**,
> see the round-6 note below), with the requested stamps moving when **any** input
> axis changes — time/asset/camera/config, not just `headVersion` (D38); name-path is addressing
> while the immutable **NodeId is the stable lineage identity** (D9/D14/D15, **charter-corrected D44**);
> derivation **splits into a bounded synchronous semantic phase** (lex→parse→CST→reference-resolution
> →typecheck) — which is what `validate` and `propose_patch`'s precommit and `rename` use — **and the
> async expensive phase** (realize/TLAS/prepare/render) that stays the arbiter's cancellable job
> (D39, reconciling D34/D35/D5); the render/derive tools take an explicit **`RenderConfig`** that is
> resolved into an **`EffectiveRenderConfig` (hashed) + a view-camera-state hash** in the stamp
> (D42), and carries a **sampling seed** that makes **`prepare` deterministic** so the
> `PreparedArtifact` cache is sound — while the **render itself is reproducible within MC tolerance**
> (review-by-image, not byte-diff; bit-identical rendering is a named future, D40, weakening D33); an
> integrator override re-runs only the config-dependent `prepare` layer, not the config-independent
> scene derivation (D22); `derive → prepare → render` run **async + cancellable on the single render
> arbiter**, off the agent/edit thread, but **only latest-wins *preview* jobs are cancelled by a newer
> head — stamp-pinned *explicit/final* renders run to completion** (D43, scoping D34), which is exactly
> the head-vs-derived lag the agent observes; `rename` runs the **same synchronous semantic phase to
> head** as derivation (refuses if head can't be derived — D25/D35/D39); a `render` of an
> animation frame derives a **time-INTERVAL** scene (motion blur gated v1-off) and the active
> animation name is part of the stamp (D31); asset bytes bind to the stamp by **content digest of the
> loaded buffer** (`assetDigest`, D41); and branch/PR history preserves the **CST only** — a
> re-derived old version uses *current* asset bytes (D28).
> **Round 6 (D45–D51) reconciles the runtime model with the real engine + the legacy `docs/gui/` GUI
> specs:** `ResolveEffectiveRenderConfig` takes the **`DerivedScene`** (not the CST) and runs **after**
> the config-independent derive — so the auto-router may inspect the assembled scene and run a **Tier-2
> probe render**, and its resolved config is hashed into the `PreparedStamp` (D45, amends D42); asset
> identity is the **content digest of the transitive byte closure** (a glTF's main file + its external
> buffers/textures), and a **pinned render job pins its whole dependency closure** so a queued render
> reproduces regardless of later disk changes (D46, amends D41/D5); **pinned renders survive a head
> change** — the legacy `RENDER_COORDINATOR.md` "drop stale jobs on revision change" rule is **superseded
> for pinned renders** (it applies to latest-wins previews only, D47); there is **exactly one render slot**
> (RISE's hard single-render invariant), so while a pinned render owns it **previews suspend/queue — they
> never run alongside** (the requester can pause/cancel the pinned render to yield the slot, D48, amends
> D43); `status:ok`/done now requires **full-stamp equality AND `phase == complete`** (phase ∈ {idle,
> deriving, routing, preparing, rendering, complete, error}) — stamp equality alone meant "the right thing
> is *being* produced," not "it *is* produced" (D49, amends D38); an explicit/pinned render **returns a
> `RenderJobId`** and its status/progress/result + `stop`/`pause`/`resume` are **per-job** — the single
> requested/published-stamp surface describes the **preview** (one, latest-wins) while pinned renders are a
> `RenderJobId`-keyed **set** (D50, amends D38/D43); and the safety contract is corrected — **commit
> guarantees *semantic* validity only** (parse/resolve/typecheck per D39), **not** full derive/render, so a
> committed head can be a **broken-but-valid CST** (its async expensive phase fails → `status:error` +
> node-local diagnostics, never silent corruption), with an **opt-in `awaitFullValidation: true`** mode on
> `propose_patch` that awaits async derive+prepare (not render) for CI/headless callers (D51, amends D39;
> supersedes `AI_SECURITY_MODEL.md`'s "full precommit gating" where it conflicts). Where a legacy
> `docs/gui/` spec (`RENDER_COORDINATOR.md`, `AI_SECURITY_MODEL.md`) contradicts a round-6 decision, the

## 1. Current-state grounding — what exists today for this facet

The agentic surface is **greenfield in code** but **richly designed on paper**, and that paper
is Model-A-shaped. Grounding both, with real file citations:

### 1.1 In code (verified)

- **No `src/Library/Agent/` directory exists.** (`ls src/Library/Agent` → *No such file or directory*.)
  Every type the `docs/gui/` AI specs name (`AgentServer`, `SceneValidator`, `SchemaGen`,
  `ProjectRootJail`, `ICredentialStore`) is design-only. The agentic surface is a clean build, not
  a retrofit — which is fortunate, because Model B changes its foundation.
- **The descriptor-driven parser is the schema source (the load-bearing asset).** Every chunk
  parser overrides `Describe()` (returns a `ChunkDescriptor` of `ParameterDescriptor`s — `name`,
  `kind`/`ValueKind`, `required`, `repeatable`, `enumValues`, `referenceCategories`, `tupleKinds`,
  `presets`, `description`, `defaultValueHint`, `unitLabel`) and `Finalize()`
  ([src/Library/Parsers/README.md](../../src/Library/Parsers/README.md);
  `ChunkDescriptor.h:110` `enum class ValueKind`). `SceneGrammar::Instance()` aggregates all
  **138 chunk keywords**. **This is charter L6** — descriptors *are* the schema; the agentic
  surface consumes it, never re-declares it. Drift between "what the parser accepts" and "what the
  descriptor advertises" is structurally impossible *within the parser*; whether a *generated JSON
  Schema* matches the parser is a separate, weaker claim (see §5 / VALIDATION_ARCHITECTURE §5).
- **The headless CLI loop already exists** in `src/RISE/commandconsole.cpp`: the
  `printf "render\nquit\n" | ./bin/rise scene.RISEscene` harness in the charter. It drives the
  `AsciiCommandParser`, whose dispatch table includes `render`/`load`/`quit`
  (`AsciiCommandParser.cpp:43-48`) and which calls `exit(1)` on a malformed command
  (`:182`) — the barrier a `validate` dry-run must structurally avoid.
- **There is no side-effect-free validation pass.** `ISceneParser::ParseAndLoadScene(IJob&)`
  parses *and mutates the Job*, returning `bool`, logging errors to `GlobalLog()` — not a struct
  with locations. There is no string-input entry point. So actionable, localized validation is
  net-new code (small; §4.3).
- **The render path is `RayCaster::AttachScene` → realize-from-roots → integrators** (deferred
  realization is in tree, memory `project_deferred_realization`). The agentic surface submits
  render *requests*; it owns none of the render machinery.

### 1.2 On paper (Model-A-era; this facet supersedes the shape, reuses the threat model)

The five `docs/gui/` AI specs are a thorough first pass written **before** the Model A→B decision.
They assume the round-4-era world: a live mutable `Scene`, a `SceneEditController` "one mutation
path," `SceneEdit`/`EditHistory`/transactions/epochs, and a `SaveEngine` that persists *some*
edits structurally (transform/property/created-camera) and falls back to **wholesale text
rewrite + reload** for the rest (e.g. non-camera creation). The headline artifacts:

- [MCP_TOOL_SURFACE.md](../gui/MCP_TOOL_SURFACE.md): a ~25-tool catalog with a `committed`-vs-`proposed`
  contract, a `baseEpoch` `(uuidHi, uuidLo, revision)` precondition on every mutating tool,
  `apply_scene_text` as the *wholesale rewrite* fallback, `validate` as the keystone, the
  `rise://*` resource catalog, and three transports (in-process / loopback-HTTP / stdio).
- [LLM_AGENT_RUNTIME.md](../gui/LLM_AGENT_RUNTIME.md): `ILLMProvider` (Claude/Gemini/local adapters),
  the agent loop, the vision feedback loop, autonomy L0–L3, `ICredentialStore`.
- [AI_SECURITY_MODEL.md](../gui/AI_SECURITY_MODEL.md): the threat model — prompt-injection quarantine,
  `ProjectRootJail`, `IOutboundUrlPolicy` (SSRF), `SecretRedactor`, the always-confirm destructive
  set, loopback-only transport, Android adb-loopback reality. **This doc adopts the threat model
  almost verbatim** — it is orthogonal to the canonical-form decision and remains correct.

**What changes under Model B, in one sentence:** when the document *is* the canonical CST and a
structured edit and a text edit are **the same operation on that CST** (charter L2), the entire
"which edits persist structurally vs which need a wholesale rewrite" axis — and the `apply_scene_text`
tool that embodied it — **collapses**. There is exactly one apply: a CST patch. §2 builds the surface
on that fact; §3 inventories the supersession.

---

## 2. The Model-B agentic surface

### 2.1 Thesis: the agent's medium is the document, so the tool surface is thin

RISE is unusually suited to be an MCP server, and Model B sharpens *why*: the scene is a
**canonical, lossless, diff-able document**, the grammar is **machine-introspectable** (L6
descriptors), and editing is **one pathway** (L2). A coding agent already knows how to operate
exactly this shape of system — **read a file, propose a patch, run the checker, observe the
result, iterate.** RISE's job is to expose that loop honestly, not to invent a parallel
"3D-API-over-JSON-RPC."

This is the central design stance, and it is a deliberate rejection of the obvious alternative:

> **Thin, not fat. We do NOT ship 200 mutation RPCs** (`setLightIntensity`, `rotateObject`,
> `addSphere`, `setMaterialRoughness`, …). A fat per-operation API would (a) re-encode the grammar
> a second time — a guaranteed-to-drift parallel schema, violating L6; (b) recreate the Model-A
> "every mutator is a fresh place to forget a step" disease the editor-state post-mortem
> ([EDITOR_STATE_AND_TRANSACTION_HARDENING.md](../gui/EDITOR_STATE_AND_TRANSACTION_HARDENING.md))
> catalogued (P-STATE / P-WALK / P-INVALIDATE — ~17 defects, 4 root patterns, all "replicated
> instead of owned by one chokepoint"); and (c) be *worse for the agent*, which reasons fluently
> over documents and diffs, not over a sprawl of imperative verbs it must discover and sequence.

The whole surface is therefore organized around **the document and its derivations**:

```
  READ            PATCH                 VALIDATE          DERIVE+RENDER        OBSERVE
  ────            ─────                 ────────          ─────────────        ───────
  read CST text   propose a CST patch   re-parse the      derive scene +       read back the
  (whole / by     (structured node-op   patched CST →     render a preview     image, the
   name-path)      OR a text patch)      structured        (incremental         numeric/structural
  read the                               errors localized  re-derive)           diffs, the
  derived graph                          to CST nodes                           diagnostics
  read the
  descriptor
  schema
```

Everything below is a small number of tools serving those five verbs. **The agent's leverage
comes from the document being good, not from the API being large.**

### 2.2 The tool set (lean by construction)

The server lives in shared C++ at **`src/Library/Agent/`** (charter: maximize shared C++; the
GUI roadmap §16 naming rule — avoid the bare `MCP` token since `src/DRISE/MCPClientConnection`
is unrelated Master-Control-Program plumbing — still holds; the C++ types are `Agent*`/`Scene*`/
`Cst*`-prefixed). It is a JSON-RPC adapter over the CST store (Facet 1), the derivation engine
(Facet 2), the edit/version layer (Facet 3), and the descriptor schema (L6). The MCP primitive
mapping is unchanged from the prior design (Resources = read-only context; Tools = model-invoked
actions; Prompts = curated workflows), but the *tools* are re-cast onto the CST.

#### 2.2.1 Read tools / resources (pull, never push)

| Tool / resource | Contract | Backed by |
|---|---|---|
| `read_document` → `rise://cst/text` | Returns `{ text, version: {headVersion}, status, diagnostics, redactions: [{offset,length}] }` — the **whole canonical CST serialized to `.RISEscene` text** (comments + formatting preserved; this is what makes diffs reviewable, §5). Stamped with **`headVersion`** (the CST truth, §2.2.1.1): the text *is* the head, so it never lags. `headVersion` is the version a `propose_patch` precondition is checked against (optimistic concurrency, §2.4). Secrets length-preservingly masked with a **single-byte** ASCII mask (`*`) so every byte offset equals the canonical document's (the AI_SECURITY_MODEL §9 redaction contract — carried over verbatim because it is offset-faithfulness, not a Model-A artifact). | Facet 1 CST → serializer |
| `read_node` → `rise://cst/node/{name-path}` | Returns one node's source span **addressed by name-path** (charter **L5**: `objects/sphere`, `objects/sphere.material`, `materials/gold.roughness`) as `{ text, nodeId, version: {headVersion}, status, spanOffset, redactions }` — stamped with **`headVersion`** like `read_document` (it reads the CST). Name-path is *addressing*, version-resolved against the head; it is **not** the durable identity (D9/D15): it changes on rename. An agent that must hold a reference to a node **across edits** keeps the returned immutable **`nodeId`** (the lineage identity) and re-addresses by name-path within a version. | Facet 1 name-path index → span |
| `read_graph` → `rise://scene/graph` | Structured introspection of the **derived** scene: objects / cameras / lights / materials / media / film, each with type, resolved property rows, bound-material links, world-space transform + bbox. Stamped with the **published `DerivedStamp = {cstVersion, assetDigest, animationName, shutterInterval}`** alongside the **`requestedDerivedStamp`** the arbiter is currently trying to produce, plus `status` + `diagnostics` (§2.2.1.1, D29/**D38**), **not** `headVersion` — when derivation lags or is broken the published stamp is what the scene actually reflects (its `cstVersion` may be a proper ancestor of head, or last-good on `status:error`; `status:ok`/done ⟺ published == requested on every axis **and** `phase == complete`, D38/**D49**). This is the **config-INDEPENDENT** `DerivedScene` (D22: `f(CST, AssetManifest, t)` — geometry, materials, lights-as-emitters, TLAS); it carries the full `DerivedStamp` but **no `RenderConfig`/`PreparedStamp`** because the graph does not depend on integrator/rasterizer selection (only the *rendered image* does, via the `PreparedRenderState` layer, §2.2.3). This is the *evaluated* view (what the CST *means*), complementary to the CST text (what the CST *says*); the requested and published `cstVersion` are both surfaced so a client is **never** told they are equal when they are not (staleness is the **DAG-ancestry** check on `cstVersion`, D29, never numeric `<`). | Facet 2 derived scene + introspection |
| `read_schema` → `rise://grammar/schema` and `rise://grammar/node/{keyword}` | The whole grammar (or one chunk) as JSON Schema generated from `SceneGrammar::Instance()` (L6). **The agent's "what is the grammar" reference** — every keyword, its category, params with kind/enum/refs/defaults/units/descriptions. A *first-pass filter, not the parser* (§5). | `SchemaGen` over descriptors |
| `read_image` → `rise://framebuffer` (+ `…/aov/{aov}`) | The latest **completed** preview as tone-mapped sRGB PNG (so a vision model sees what a human sees), with `?exposure`/`?max_dim`/`?region` query params, a `generation` counter so the agent can tell "is this the frame I asked for?", and the full **`PreparedStamp = DerivedStamp + {effectiveRenderConfigHash, viewCameraStateHash, samplingSeed}`** the frame was rendered from (D29/**D42**). **"Completed" is `phase == complete` (D49)** — a frame whose stamp matches but is still rendering (`phase == rendering`) is not yet served as final. This default reads the **preview** (latest-wins); a **pinned** render's image is read **per-job** with `?job={RenderJobId}` (D50, §2.2.3) — the `DerivedStamp` half is the derived snapshot (whose `cstVersion` may be a proper ancestor of head), and the `{effectiveRenderConfigHash, viewCameraStateHash, samplingSeed}` half fixes the pixels: the **`effectiveRenderConfigHash`** is the content hash of the *resolved* `EffectiveRenderConfig` (scene-authored settings ← request overrides ← defaults ← auto-resolution, D42 — **not** the raw request), and **`viewCameraStateHash`** is a content hash of the complete ephemeral view-camera state (pose, lens — **not** a `CameraId`, which cannot identify a continuously-changing viewport pose). Two images sharing a `DerivedStamp` differ when their `effectiveRenderConfigHash`/`viewCameraStateHash`/`samplingSeed` differ; two images with the **same `PreparedStamp` are reproducible within MC tolerance** (D40 — the seed makes `prepare`/photon maps deterministic, so the same converged image up to Monte-Carlo noise; review-by-image, not byte-diff — bit-identical rendering is a named future). AOVs (albedo/normal/depth/objectid/alpha) visualized; raw float via `?format=exr`. Never *triggers* a render. | Facet 2 render output / FrameStore |
| `read_diagnostics` → `rise://render/stats`, `…/autoroute`, `rise://log` | Render telemetry (resolution, samples, ETA, **`phase` + `progress`** per §2.2.1.1/D49), the auto-router's resolved integrator + one-line reason ("Auto → BDPT: glossy/indirect variance high"), and the redacted log tail. Stamped with the render's **published `PreparedStamp`** (+ the `requestedPreparedStamp`) + `phase`/`status` (§2.2.1.1, D29/**D38**/**D49**) — it describes the render of a `PreparedRenderState`, whose `DerivedStamp.cstVersion` may be a proper ancestor of head. This default describes the **preview**; a **pinned** render's telemetry is read **per-job** with `?job={RenderJobId}` (D50). The numeric/structural channel the agent observes alongside the image. | counters / `AutoRasterizer` / log sink |

`read_*` tools carry **no precondition** and read a **published immutable snapshot** of the CST +
its derivation (never the live tree), so they answer concurrently with edits without tearing
(Facet 3 owns the snapshot contract).

##### 2.2.1.1 The coherent version surface — requested vs published full stamps, `ok` ⟺ full-stamp equality **AND phase==complete**, compared by ancestry not `<`; the preview surface vs the `RenderJobId`-keyed pinned set (per [`01-DECISIONS.md`](01-DECISIONS.md) §D13, **§D29**, **§D38**, **§D42**, **§D49**, **§D50**)

A single stamped `documentId` shared by the CST read and the graph/render reads **tears**: derivation
is async (and may serve a *last-good* snapshot on error), so when head N is broken or still deriving
while the graph/render reflects an ancestor, one id is a lie. **D29 sharpens D13's single
`derivedVersion`:** a `DerivedScene` depends not only on the CST version but on the asset content, the
active animation, and the shutter interval — so two scenes at one `cstVersion` (t=0 vs t=1, or pre/post
an asset change) must be distinguishable. The derived/rendered reads therefore carry **full stamps**,
not a lone `derivedVersion`, and staleness is a **DAG-ancestry** test on the `cstVersion` axis (never
numeric `<` — the version DAG branches; the other axes are equality-matched).

**D38 splits each stamp into *requested* and *published* halves.** Publishing only what the arbiter
*produced* still tears in a subtler way: when time/asset/camera/config change **without** changing
`headVersion`, a client cannot see what the arbiter is *trying* to produce versus what it has actually
produced. So the status surface exposes **both** `requestedDerivedStamp`/`requestedPreparedStamp` (the
target — set whenever **any** input axis changes: cstVersion, asset, animation, shutter,
effective-config, view-camera, seed — not just the CST head) **and**
`publishedDerivedStamp`/`publishedPreparedStamp` (what the arbiter has finished). **`status:ok`/done
requires full-stamp equality AND `phase == complete` (D49)** — published == requested on **every** axis
*and* the output image for that stamp actually exists (samples-done / converged); otherwise the status
is `deriving | routing | preparing | rendering`. **D49 closes a gap in D38's stamp-only `ok`:** the
`PreparedRenderState` is published *before* rendering starts, so `requested == published` stamps can
match for the entire duration of the render — stamp equality alone means "the right thing is *being*
produced," not "it *is* produced." So status carries an explicit **`phase` ∈ {idle, deriving, routing,
preparing, rendering, complete, error}** plus progress, and `ok`/done is gated on `phase == complete`.
The session publishes **one coherent status value** (describing the **preview** — one, latest-wins;
**pinned renders are a separate `RenderJobId`-keyed set**, D50/§2.2.3), and the read/return contracts
stamp the right half of it:

```jsonc
{ "headVersion": { "uuidHi", "uuidLo", "revision" },   // the CST truth (what read_document returns)

  // A DerivedStamp identifies a DerivedScene (config-INDEPENDENT view, e.g. read_graph):
  //   shape = { cstVersion:{uuidHi,uuidLo,revision}, // may be a DAG-ancestor of head, or last-good
  //             assetDigest,        // content digest of the loaded bytes (D41); for a composite asset (glTF),
  //                                 //   the digest of its TRANSITIVE byte closure — main + buffers + textures (D46)
  //             animationName,      // the active animation path (D31)
  //             shutterInterval }   // single-time [t,t] in v1; an interval under motion blur (D31)
  // A PreparedStamp = DerivedStamp + render axes; identifies a PreparedRenderState (the rendered image):
  //   shape = { derivedStamp,
  //             effectiveRenderConfigHash, // content hash of the RESOLVED EffectiveRenderConfig (D42), not the raw request;
  //                                        //   resolved by ResolveEffectiveRenderConfig(DerivedScene,…) AFTER derive, may probe (D45)
  //             viewCameraStateHash,       // content hash of the ephemeral view-camera pose+lens (D42), not a CameraId
  //             samplingSeed }             // D40 — makes prepare deterministic; render reproducible within MC tolerance

  // D38/D50 — these requested/published stamps describe the PREVIEW (one, latest-wins).
  //           Pinned (explicit/final) renders are a SEPARATE RenderJobId-keyed set, §2.2.3.
  // The arbiter is TRYING to produce the requested stamps; it has PUBLISHED what it finished:
  "requestedDerivedStamp":  { /* DerivedStamp  — target; updates when ANY input axis changes (time/asset/camera/config) */ },
  "requestedPreparedStamp": { /* PreparedStamp — target */ },
  "publishedDerivedStamp":  { /* DerivedStamp  — what the arbiter has finished (may be a DAG-ancestor of head, or last-good) */ },
  "publishedPreparedStamp": { /* PreparedStamp — what the arbiter has finished */ },

  "snapshot":    "<opaque derived-snapshot handle>",
  "phase":       "idle | deriving | routing | preparing | rendering | complete | error", // D49 — routing = ResolveEffectiveRenderConfig/probe (D45)
  "progress":    0.0,                                                                     // D49 — fraction toward completion
  "status":      "deriving | routing | preparing | rendering | ok | error", // ok/done ⟺ published == requested on EVERY axis (D38) AND phase == complete (D49)
  "diagnostics": [ /* ValidationReport entries, §2.5 — explain a lag, a failure, or a broken-but-valid head (D51) */ ] }
```

- **CST reads** (`read_document`, `read_node`) are stamped with **`headVersion`** — the text *is* the
  head, so it cannot lag.
- **Derived reads** carry the right stamp, in **both requested and published halves** (D38): the
  **config-independent** view (`read_graph`, D22) carries the **`DerivedStamp`** pair
  (`requestedDerivedStamp` + `publishedDerivedStamp`); the **rendered** reads (`read_image`,
  `read_diagnostics`, and `render`'s/`derive_preview`'s result) carry the full **`PreparedStamp`** pair
  — because an image is a `PreparedRenderState = prepare(DerivedScene, EffectiveRenderConfig)`, so the
  same `DerivedStamp` under two resolved configs (or two seeds) yields two distinguishable images,
  while two reads with the **same `PreparedStamp` are reproducible within MC tolerance** (D40 — the
  seed makes `prepare`/photon maps deterministic; the render is the same converged image up to
  Monte-Carlo noise, not byte-for-byte). A *published* stamp's `cstVersion` **may be a proper ancestor
  of head** (derivation in flight) or a **last-good** snapshot (`status:error`); `status` +
  `diagnostics` explain *why* it lags or failed.
- **`status:ok`/done ⟺ full-stamp equality (D38) AND `phase == complete` (D49).** The status is `ok`
  **only** when the published stamp equals the requested stamp on **every** axis (`cstVersion`,
  `assetDigest`, `animationName`, `shutterInterval`, `effectiveRenderConfigHash`, `viewCameraStateHash`,
  `samplingSeed`) **and** the `phase` has reached `complete` (the output image for that stamp exists,
  with its own samples-done / converged completion marker); otherwise it is
  `deriving | routing | preparing | rendering`. **Stamp equality alone is not `ok` (D49):** the
  `PreparedRenderState` is published before the render starts, so the stamps can match while the render
  is still in flight (`phase == rendering`) — equality means "the right thing is *being* produced," and
  only `phase == complete` means "it *is* produced." Because the **requested** stamps update when
  **any** input axis changes (time/asset/camera/config, not just `headVersion`), a client sees `ok`
  revert to `deriving|routing|preparing|rendering` even when the CST head is untouched — e.g. the user
  scrubbed the timeline, an asset changed on disk, or the view-camera moved.
- **Staleness = DAG ancestry, not `<` (D29).** "Is this published derived/rendered view stale vs the
  requested target?" is decided on the **`cstVersion` axis only**, by checking whether the published
  stamp's `cstVersion` is an **ancestor-or-equal** of the requested/head `cstVersion` in the version
  DAG — **not** a numeric `revision` comparison (the DAG has branches, so `<` is meaningless across
  them). The other stamp axes (`assetDigest`/`animationName`/`shutterInterval`, and the render axes
  `effectiveRenderConfigHash`/`viewCameraStateHash`/`samplingSeed`) are matched by **equality**, not
  order.
- **Clients are never told the two are equal when they are not.** A vision agent that reads an image
  whose `publishedPreparedStamp.derivedStamp.cstVersion` is a strict ancestor of the requested
  `cstVersion` (or whose published stamp differs from requested on any axis, or whose `phase ≠ complete`,
  so `status ≠ ok`) knows it is looking at a stale or still-rendering frame and can wait for `status:ok`
  (full-stamp equality **and** `phase == complete`, D49) or re-`render`.
- **This surface describes the PREVIEW; pinned renders are a `RenderJobId`-keyed set (D50).** The single
  `requested*`/`published*` stamp pair above is the **latest-wins preview** (one — a newer head moves the
  requested stamp and cancels the in-flight preview, D43). An **explicit/pinned** render
  (`render{pinned:true}`) instead returns a **`RenderJobId`** and lives in a separate set, each job
  carrying its **own pinned `requestedPreparedStamp` + `phase`** (D49) and **per-job** status/progress/
  result + `stop`/`pause`/`resume` (D50, §2.2.3). A newer head does **not** disturb a pinned job's stamp
  (it is pinned, D47); only the preview's requested stamp tracks head.
- A **`propose_patch` precondition** (optimistic concurrency, §2.4) is checked against
  **`headVersion`** — the CST is what a patch rebases on, not the (possibly-lagging) derived scene.

Every tool result shape below reflects whichever stamp it is stamped with; nothing emits a bare
`documentId` that straddles both. (Facet 3 owns publishing this status alongside each snapshot;
Facet 5 only consumes and re-exposes it.)

#### 2.2.2 The patch tool — one apply, two patch encodings

This is the heart of the redesign. There is **one mutating verb** with **two equivalent encodings**,
because the CST is the single canonical object and both encodings produce the same thing: a versioned
CST patch.

| Tool | Contract |
|---|---|
| `propose_patch` | `{ baseHeadVersion: {uuidHi,uuidLo,revision}, patch: <CstPatch \| TextPatch>, intent?: string, awaitFullValidation?: bool=false }`. The precondition is **checked against `headVersion`** (the CST truth, §2.2.1.1), not the derived scene — a patch rebases on the head. **Validated by the bounded synchronous semantic phase** — lex → parse → CST → bind-to-descriptor → **reference resolution** → typecheck (D39) — before it is allowed to commit (§2.4); this precommit is **not** a full async derive (no realization, TLAS, prepare, or render; D39 reconciles this with D34's "all the *expensive* derivation is async"). **Commit therefore guarantees *semantic* validity only, NOT full derive/render success (D51):** a committed head may be a **broken-but-valid CST** whose async expensive phase later fails (a missing/changed asset, bad geometry) — that surfaces as `status:error` + node-local diagnostics against the published stamp (§2.2.1.1/§2.5), **never** a silent corruption and **never** a half-edited document (the invalid-patch case is rejected pre-commit, #5/§2.6). On success the commit is cheap and returns immediately with the bumped `headVersion`; **the async expensive phase — realize/TLAS → routing (D45) → `prepare` → `render` — then runs cancellably on the arbiter, off this thread** (D34/D39), so the coherent status fills the requested→published `DerivedStamp`/`PreparedStamp` + `phase`/`status`/`diagnostics` as it proceeds (§2.5/§2.6). **`awaitFullValidation:true` (D51)** flips this to a synchronous commit that **awaits the async derive+prepare (NOT the render)** before returning, reporting the commit as *fully validated* (or returning the derive/prepare diagnostics) — for CI/headless callers that need the stronger guarantee; the default is the fast semantic-only commit. A newer `propose_patch` **cancels the in-flight latest-wins *preview* work** but **not** a stamp-pinned explicit/final render (D43, §2.2.3). A lost-race precondition returns a `CONFLICT` carrying the live `headVersion`. |

The two `patch` encodings:

1. **Structured patch (`CstPatch`)** — a list of node operations addressed by **name-path** (L5):
   ```jsonc
   { "kind": "cst", "ops": [
     { "op": "set",    "path": "lights/key.power",    "value": "1500" },
     { "op": "set",    "path": "lights/key.color",    "value": "1.0 0.85 0.7" },
     { "op": "add",    "path": "objects/",            "chunk_text": "standard_object\n{\n  …\n}\n" },
     { "op": "remove", "path": "objects/old_crate" },
     { "op": "rename", "path": "materials/gold",      "to": "brass" }
   ] }
   ```
   `set` edits one parameter on an existing node; `add` inserts a new chunk (full chunk text,
   schema-shaped); `remove` deletes a node; `rename` rewrites a node's name **in place** — it is a
   **NodeId-preserving** op (D9), so it changes the node's name-path but not its lineage identity, and
   it fixes up referrers from the traced `ReferenceUse` records (D14), flagging any it cannot resolve
   rather than silently leaving a dangling reference. **The `ReferenceUse` trace `rename` rewrites
   from must be stamped for the exact head it renames against (D25), and it comes from the *one*
   resolution path — derivation's own resolver (D35):** because the published derived view can lag head
   (the published `DerivedStamp.cstVersion` may be a proper DAG-ancestor of head, §2.2.1.1), a referrer
   added in head-but-not-yet-derived would otherwise be missed, silently leaving a dangling old name. So
   `rename` obtains head's reference set with **the exact same evaluator/resolver as derivation —
   there is no separate "reference-tracing pass" reimplementation that could drift** (D35 corrects
   D25's standalone tracing pass; D4 demoted static schema walks *precisely because* dynamic refs like
   `timeline.element` need real reference resolution). Concretely, if the resolved reference set is not
   already at head the rename **runs the bounded synchronous semantic phase to head** — lex → parse →
   CST → bind-to-descriptor → **reference resolution** → typecheck (D39) — and reads the resulting
   traced `ReferenceUse`. This is the **same sync semantic phase `validate`/`propose_patch`-precommit
   use, and it is the front of the async derive job (so it is not a second resolver, D35)** — **not** a
   full async derive (no realization/TLAS/prepare/render): rename needs the reference graph, which the
   bounded semantic phase produces, not the realized scene. Rename is a deliberate, infrequent op, so a
   synchronous run-to-head of that bounded phase is acceptable. A `rename` **never** runs against a stale
   trace; **if the semantic phase cannot resolve head (a semantic error), the rename is refused** (not
   best-effort, not silently partial). **Scope note (D39):** the sync phase resolves references to
   **CST-declared** name-paths; references *into* asset-expanded sub-entities (e.g. a glTF import's
   children) need the async phase and are out of v1 cross-reference scope. This is the encoding the
   **GUI emits** for a
   slider drag or a panel edit (L2: the GUI is an agent that speaks `CstPatch`). It is the
   *preferred* agent encoding too, because it is minimal, name-path-anchored, and trivially
   diff-reviewable.

2. **Text patch (`TextPatch`)** — a unified-diff-style or span-replace edit against the CST's
   serialized text:
   ```jsonc
   { "kind": "text", "edits": [ { "offset": 1842, "length": 6, "replacement": "1500" } ] }
   // or { "kind": "text", "unified_diff": "--- a/scene\n+++ b/scene\n@@ … @@\n-  power 1000\n+  power 1500\n" }
   ```
   This is the encoding a **coding-style agent reaches for instinctively** (it just edited a file).
   The server applies it to the canonical text, **re-parses into a CST** (Facet 1's parser is the
   one that produces the canonical tree), and proceeds identically to the structured path.

**Both encodings converge to one internal operation:** *produce a candidate CST → validate it →
commit it as a new version*. There is no "structured-save can represent this but a text edit needs
a wholesale reload" fork (the Model-A `apply_scene_text` distinction) — under Model B **every** edit
is a CST patch, and a "wholesale" replacement is just a `TextPatch` whose span is the whole document.
A whole-document text patch is **not** a special undoable-history-destroying "document swap"; it is one
more versioned CST patch (Facet 3 owns whether a large text patch is diffed structurally or stored
as a coarse version — but it is *always* a version, never a re-root that loses history). The hazardous
"feeding back redacted text overwrites real secrets" problem is handled the same way as before
(§2.4 #4 / AI_SECURITY_MODEL §3.1 #4): a whole-document `TextPatch` derived from a read that carried
`redactions[]` is refused; the agent is steered to scoped `CstPatch` ops that never touch a masked span.

> **Why two encodings and not one?** The agent population is heterogeneous. A Claude-Code-style agent
> *thinks in file edits*; forcing it through a structured AST API fights its grain. A GUI *thinks in
> node operations*; forcing it to render-then-text-diff a slider drag is absurd. Offering both — over
> **one canonical CST and one commit path** — serves both clients without a second source of truth.
> The text encoding is the agent's escape hatch for edits awkward to express structurally (reordering
> blocks, bulk comment edits, large refactors); the structured encoding is the precise, reviewable
> default. Facet 1 guarantees they round-trip to the same canonical form (INV-4).

#### 2.2.3 Render & derivation tools (no scene mutation)

These tools take a **`RenderConfig`** request and surface the **two-layer derivation** (D22) with a
**routing step between the two layers** (D45). The config-**independent**
`DerivedScene = f(CST, AssetManifest, t)` (geometry, materials, lights-as-emitters, TLAS — what
`read_graph` reflects) is derived once and cached; then the request is **resolved into an
`EffectiveRenderConfig` by `ResolveEffectiveRenderConfig(DerivedScene, request)`** (D45/D42, §2.2.3.1)
— a step that runs **after `DerivedScene` exists** so the auto-router can inspect the assembled
geometry/lights and **may run a Tier-2 probe render** to pick the integrator; finally the
config-**dependent** `PreparedRenderState = prepare(DerivedScene, EffectiveRenderConfig)` (light
samplers, photon maps, integrator-specific structures) is what the *image* reflects. The agent reads a
`DerivedScene`; it renders a `PreparedRenderState`. An integrator/rasterizer override therefore re-runs
**only routing + `prepare`**, never the scene derivation — so swapping integrators never invalidates
the graph the agent just read (the `DerivedScene` stays config-independent; D22 holds — routing sits
*between* derive and prepare, D45).

**Four round-4/5/6 properties govern these tools (D40, D34/D43/D47/D48, D42/D45, D50):**

- **`prepare` is deterministic; the render is reproducible *within MC tolerance* (D40, weakening D33).**
  `RenderConfig` carries a **sampling seed / RNG-stream identity**; the seed is part of the
  `PreparedStamp` (D29/D42). The seed makes **`prepare` (photon maps) deterministic** — the same
  `PreparedStamp` always yields the same photon maps, so the `PreparedArtifact` cache is sound (this is
  all D33's cache-soundness actually needed). The **final render is NOT bit-identical**: renderers use
  per-worker independently-seeded RNGs plus `GlobalRNG()`, and tile assignment / splat reduction /
  denoise also vary — so a single seed yields the **same converged image only up to Monte-Carlo
  tolerance**, not byte-for-byte. The git-native/agentic win is therefore **review-by-image, not
  byte-diff** (§2.7): renders are re-runnable and a regression bisect re-renders to the *same image
  within MC noise*. **Bit-identical rendering** (deterministic per-pixel/per-sample RNG streams,
  deterministic splat reduction, deterministic denoise — across every renderer) is a **named future
  option, not v1.**
- **Async & cancellable on the render arbiter, off the edit thread; latest-wins previews vs
  stamp-pinned renders (D34/D43); ONE render slot, previews suspend during a pinned render (D48);
  pinned renders survive a head change (D47).** The edit/agent thread only **commits a CST `Version`**
  (cheap). The **single render arbiter** asynchronously runs
  `derive → seal → route (D45) → prepare → seal → render` as **cancellable phases of its render job**.
  There are **two job classes (D43):** *latest-wins preview* jobs (interactive viewport previews) track
  head — a newer head (a newer `propose_patch`) **cancels** the in-flight preview and restarts at the
  new stamp; *stamp-pinned* explicit/final/export renders are **pinned to their `requestedPreparedStamp`**
  and a newer head does **not** cancel them — they run to completion (cancelled only by their requester,
  D50). So **an unrelated edit can never silently destroy a requested final render** — and the legacy
  `RENDER_COORDINATOR.md` "drop all queued/completed jobs on a revision change" rule is **superseded for
  pinned renders** (it applies to **preview** jobs only; pinned jobs survive the head/revision change,
  D47). **There is exactly ONE render slot — RISE's hard single-render invariant (a render takes all
  cores; two concurrent renders make the machine unusable, D48)** — so while a **pinned render owns the
  slot, previews SUSPEND/queue; they do NOT run alongside** (the newest pending preview runs when the
  slot frees — latest-wins among queued previews). A routing **probe render (D45)** also takes the slot
  briefly. The requester can **pause/cancel** the pinned render (D50) to yield the slot. Nothing
  expensive (derive, photon-map build, route, prepare, render) ever runs on the agent/edit thread, so a
  `propose_patch` returns immediately while the heavy work proceeds asynchronously. **This async,
  cancellable, single-slot pipeline is exactly the source of the head-vs-published lag the agent
  observes** (§2.2.1.1): when a *published* stamp's `cstVersion` is a proper ancestor of head, the
  arbiter is mid-`derive`/`route`/`prepare`/`render` on an older stamp (or a preview was cancelled by a
  newer patch, or is suspended behind a pinned render). The arbiter is also where the single-slot
  scheduling and the pinned-render queue live — this facet does **not** re-invent it.
- **Pinned renders have per-job identity (`RenderJobId`) and targeted control (D50).** An explicit/pinned
  render **returns a `RenderJobId`**; its status, progress, result/output, and `stop`/`pause`/`resume`
  are **per-job** (keyed by `RenderJobId`). The single requested/published-stamp surface (§2.2.1.1)
  describes the **preview** (latest-wins, one); **pinned renders are a `RenderJobId`-keyed set**, each
  with its own pinned stamp + `phase` (D49). So several queued pinned renders are individually
  addressable, and `stop`/`pause` never accidentally hit the wrong one.
- **The stamp carries the *resolved* `EffectiveRenderConfig` + a *view-camera-state* hash, resolved
  AFTER derive (D42/D45).** What fixes the pixels is **not** the raw request: it is the
  deterministically-resolved `EffectiveRenderConfig` (its content hash), produced by
  `ResolveEffectiveRenderConfig(DerivedScene, request)` *after* the config-independent derive (D45 — so
  auto-routing can inspect the assembled scene and may probe-render), plus a content hash of the
  ephemeral view-camera state — see §2.2.3.1.

| Tool | Contract |
|---|---|
| `render` | Takes a **`RenderConfig`** request (D22, D40, D42/D45): `{ integrator?: enum[auto,pt,bdpt,vcm,…], quality?: enum[draft,preview,final] \| {samples}, resolution?, region?, denoise?: bool, seed?: <rng-stream id>, frame?: {animation?: name, time?} \| {animation?: name, shutter?: [t0,t1]}, pinned?: bool, return_image?: bool=true }` — the rasterizer/integrator request (plus the render-time integrator override) **and the sampling seed / RNG-stream id (D40)**. **Returns a `RenderJobId`** when `pinned:true` (D50) so the pinned job's status/progress/result + `stop`/`pause`/`resume` are addressable per-job; a preview render uses the single latest-wins surface (§2.2.1.1). The request is **resolved into an `EffectiveRenderConfig` by `ResolveEffectiveRenderConfig(DerivedScene, request)` — *after* the config-independent derive (D45)**, so auto-routing inspects the assembled scene and **may run a Tier-2 probe render**; that resolved config (its content hash), together with the `DerivedScene` and a **view-camera-state hash**, fixes the rendered pixels (D42, §2.2.3.1); the seed makes **`prepare` deterministic** and the render **reproducible within MC tolerance** (review-by-image, not byte-diff — D40). Submits a render of the **current derived scene** to the single render arbiter; the arbiter runs the async expensive phase `realize → route (D45) → prepare → render` **cancellably** off the edit thread (D34). **Exactly one render owns the slot (D48 — RISE's hard single-render invariant):** RENDER_COORDINATOR's preempt/queue semantics survive **but its "drop stale jobs on revision change" applies to *previews* only** (pinned jobs survive a head change, D47), and previews **suspend/queue while a pinned render owns the slot — they never run alongside** (D48); a routing probe takes the slot briefly; this facet does **not** re-invent scheduling. **Preview vs pinned (D43):** the default interactive render is a **latest-wins preview** — a newer head (`propose_patch`) **cancels** it; an explicit/final/export render sets **`pinned:true`** and is **stamp-pinned to its `requestedPreparedStamp`** — a newer head does **not** cancel it (cancellable only by its requester via its `RenderJobId`, D50), so an unrelated edit never destroys a requested final render. A **pinned** render also **pins its asset dependency closure** (D46) so a queued render reproduces regardless of later on-disk changes. **An integrator override re-runs only route + `prepare(DerivedScene, EffectiveRenderConfig)` → `PreparedRenderState`** (the config-DEPENDENT layer — light samplers, photon maps), **not** the config-INDEPENDENT scene derivation (D22/D45): the `DerivedScene` the agent reads via `read_graph` is unchanged by an integrator swap; only what the image reflects changes. **An animation frame is rendered against a time-INTERVAL `DerivedScene`** (D31): the `frame` selects the active **animation by name** (part of the `DerivedStamp`, D29) and a shutter interval `[t0,t1]`; animated quantities are baked as immutable read-only functions over the shutter so per-sample motion blur needs no scene mutation. **Motion blur is gated v1-off:** v1 renders **single-time** (`shutter` collapses to one instant, `[t,t]`); the interval scene + motion-BVH path is the named follow-on (D31), and motion blur is **not retired**. The result is stamped with the full **`PreparedStamp`** it ran against (§2.2.1.1, D29/D42 — `DerivedStamp` + `{effectiveRenderConfigHash, viewCameraStateHash, samplingSeed}`) plus its `phase` (D49 — `complete` only when the image exists). `integrator:"auto"` routes through the auto-rasterizer (post-derive, D45) and its resolved choice is **part of the `EffectiveRenderConfig`** (D42); the result echoes `{ resolved, reason }`. A `preview` runs against a private film so it never tears a live framebuffer. **OIDN on for finals** (memory: denoise always on); `denoise:false` only for diagnostic A/B. |
| `stop_render` / `pause_render` / `resume_render` | `{ job?: RenderJobId }` — cooperative cancel/pause/resume via the arbiter. **Targeted per-job (D50):** with a `job` (a pinned render's `RenderJobId`) the call addresses that specific pinned job — pausing/cancelling it **yields the single render slot** (D48) so a suspended preview (or another queued pinned job) can run; **without** `job` it targets the **latest-wins preview** (the one preview surface, §2.2.1.1). This is how a requester yields the slot held by a pinned render (D48/D50). **There is no process-exit tool** (AI_SECURITY_MODEL §5). |
| `derive_preview` (optional) | `{ baseHeadVersion, patch, render_config?: RenderConfig }` — derive a candidate patch's **config-INDEPENDENT** `DerivedScene` **without committing it** (D22), returning the graph diff and (optionally, when `render_config` is supplied) a preview render. The graph diff is **stamped with the candidate's `DerivedStamp` + `phase`/`status`** (§2.2.1.1, D29/D49: a preview is a derived view); an attached preview image is additionally stamped with the full **`PreparedStamp`** used (`DerivedStamp` + `{effectiveRenderConfigHash, viewCameraStateHash, samplingSeed}`, D42), whose `EffectiveRenderConfig` is resolved by `ResolveEffectiveRenderConfig(DerivedScene, request)` **after** the candidate derive (D45) — and because the seed makes `prepare` deterministic, the attached preview is **reproducible within MC tolerance** (same `PreparedStamp` → the same converged image up to Monte-Carlo noise, not byte-for-byte — D40; an integrator choice runs only route + `prepare` on the candidate `DerivedScene`, D22/D45). The candidate's expensive phase (realize/route/prepare/render) runs on the **arbiter, async + cancellable, on the single render slot** (D34/D48); a `derive_preview` is a **latest-wins preview job** (D43 — never pinned, so it carries no `RenderJobId` and **suspends while a pinned render owns the slot**, D48), so a newer `propose_patch` cancels an in-flight `derive_preview`. The "what would this change look like" dry-run, decoupled from commit. Implemented atop Facet 2's incremental derivation against a throwaway derivation context. Lets an L1 agent show the user a *rendered* preview of a proposal before it lands. |

Render tools carry **no document precondition** (they don't mutate the CST); a render's result is
stamped with the full **`PreparedStamp`** it ran against plus its `phase` (§2.2.1.1, D29/D42/D49 — so
two renders sharing a `DerivedStamp` are distinguishable when their
`effectiveRenderConfigHash`/`viewCameraStateHash`/`samplingSeed` differ, while two renders with the
same `PreparedStamp` are reproducible within MC tolerance, D40, and `phase == complete` distinguishes a
finished image from one still rendering, D49). A render whose published `DerivedStamp.cstVersion` a
newer head has since superseded (decided by **DAG ancestry**, not numeric `<`, D29) is reconciled as
*stale* — the stamp makes the staleness visible — not rejected. For a **latest-wins preview** the
arbiter typically **cancels** the in-flight job and restarts at the new stamp rather than leaving the
agent to poll a stale frame (D34); a **stamp-pinned** explicit/final render (D43) instead **runs to
completion** at its `requestedPreparedStamp` — a newer head does **not** cancel it (the legacy
`RENDER_COORDINATOR.md` revision-stale-drop is **preview-only**, D47) — and is simply marked
stale-vs-head while it finishes, so a requested final render is never silently abandoned. Because there
is **one render slot** (D48), a pinned render in flight **suspends** any pending preview until it
finishes or its requester pauses/cancels it (per-job via `RenderJobId`, D50) to yield the slot.

##### 2.2.3.1 Resolving the request to an `EffectiveRenderConfig` (AFTER derive; may probe), and stamping the view camera (per [`01-DECISIONS.md`](01-DECISIONS.md) §D42, **§D45**)

A raw `RenderConfig` **request** is not what fixes the pixels, for two reasons (D42). First, several
sources contribute to the actual render settings — scene-authored rasterizer/integrator settings,
the request's overrides, defaults, and **auto-resolution** (e.g. the auto-rasterizer's resolved
integrator/resolution) — with **no defined merge** if the stamp carried only the request. So the
arbiter calls a deterministic **`ResolveEffectiveRenderConfig(DerivedScene, request) ->
EffectiveRenderConfig`** (merge order: scene-authored <- request overrides <- defaults <-
auto-resolution), and the **normalized result + its content hash** (`effectiveRenderConfigHash`) goes
in the `PreparedStamp` — **not** the raw request. **Crucially this resolution runs on the
`DerivedScene`, NOT the CST, and AFTER the config-independent derive (D45, correcting D42's
`(CST, request)`):** the shipped `auto_rasterizer` (the Candidate-C dispatcher) **inspects the assembled
scene** (geometry, lights) and **may run a bounded Tier-2 probe render** to pick the integrator, so it
cannot resolve from CST text alone — routing is a step *between* `derive` and `prepare`, and the
`DerivedScene` stays config-independent (D22 holds). The probe render is a bounded sub-step that **takes
the single render slot (D48) briefly**, and with the sampling seed (D40) it is deterministic, so the
resolved config is **cacheable by (`DerivedScene`-version, request)**. Two requests that resolve to the
same effective config therefore share a `PreparedStamp` (and the cache hits); `integrator:"auto"`'s
resolved choice is captured *inside* the effective config, so an auto-routed render and an explicit
render of the same resolved integrator are the same stamp.

Second, the **viewport camera is an ephemeral pose**, not a stored `CameraId` — it changes
continuously as the user orbits — so a `CameraId` cannot identify it. The stamp instead carries a
**content hash / generation of the complete view-camera state** (pose, lens): `viewCameraStateHash`.
So `PreparedStamp = DerivedStamp + { effectiveRenderConfigHash, viewCameraStateHash, samplingSeed }`.
This is why a view-camera move (the user orbits) flips `status` away from `ok` even with the CST head
untouched (D38): the **requested** `PreparedStamp`'s `viewCameraStateHash` changed, so published is no
longer equal to requested until the arbiter re-renders.

#### 2.2.4 The keystone — `validate`

| Tool | Contract |
|---|---|
| `validate` | `{ text: string }` (whole scene) **or** `{ node_text: string }` (one chunk) **or** `{ baseHeadVersion, patch }` (validate a patch applied to the current CST head). Runs **exactly the bounded synchronous semantic phase** — lex → parse → CST → bind-to-descriptor → **reference resolution (traced `ReferenceUse`)** → type/pipe/typecheck (D39) — and returns a structured `ValidationReport` (§2.5). It is **not** a full async derive: no realization/tessellation, no asset I/O beyond identity, no TLAS, no prepare, no render. **No side effects.** |

`validate` is what makes the agent **self-correcting** — it is the `tsc`/`cargo check`/`pytest` of
RISE. **It is the bounded synchronous semantic phase (D39)** — the same code that runs as the *front*
of the async derive job (so `validate` is **not a second resolver**, D35) and the same phase
`propose_patch`'s precommit and `rename` use; the expensive realize/TLAS/prepare/render work is the
arbiter's async job (D34), never part of `validate`. The agent emits a patch, validates, reads precise
descriptor diagnostics localized to CST nodes, fixes its output, and only *then* commits. This is the
same loop a careful human hand-editor runs, and it is the reason text-as-truth is the differentiator.
Net-new but small (§4.3).

#### 2.2.5 Prompts (curated workflows, no inherent authority)

A short set surfaced as slash commands (in-app and external): `relight{mood}`, `diagnose_dark_render`
(walks the [effective-rise-scene-authoring](../skills/effective-rise-scene-authoring.md) checklist —
directional-light sign, `power` semantics, colour space), `lighting_variants{n}`, `explain_autoroute`.
Prompts expand to messages the model executes via the tools above; all guardrails (§2.4) still apply.

**That is the entire mutating surface: `propose_patch` + `validate` + `render`/`stop`/`derive_preview`.**
Five-ish verbs, one canonical object. Compare the Model-A `docs/gui/` catalog's `set_property`,
`set_transform`, `apply_material`, `load_hdri`, `add_entity`, `remove_entity`, `clone_entity`,
`set_active_camera`, `frame_object`, `set_lens`, `create_camera`, `apply_scene_text`, … — every one
of those is now **a `CstPatch` op the agent expresses against the document**, not a bespoke RPC with
its own schema and its own persistence story. (Convenience *prompts* can still name common operations
in natural language; they desugar to patches.)

### 2.3 The edit→validate→derive→render→observe loop, mapped onto the coding-agent loop

The loop is **literally the coding-agent loop**, which is the product thesis. Side by side:

| Coding agent | RISE agent | RISE mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| read source file | `read_document` / `read_node` / `read_graph` | CST text + derived graph from a snapshot |
| know the language | `read_schema` | descriptor-generated JSON Schema (L6) |
| write an edit (diff) | build a `CstPatch` or `TextPatch` | one patch tool, two encodings (§2.2.2) |
| **`tsc` / `cargo check`** | **`validate`** | re-parse → structured errors at CST nodes (§2.5) |
| build / run | `propose_patch` (commit) → `render` | commit the CST patch → derive (Facet 2) → render |
| **read test output / logs** | **`read_image` + `read_diagnostics`** | framebuffer (vision) + stats/variance/log |
| iterate | loop | feed errors/diffs/image back; repeat |

```

**How errors come back actionable.** The MCP spec distinguishes *protocol errors* (malformed
request the model can't fix — kept rare by precise schemas) from *tool-execution errors*
(`{ content, isError:true }` — actionable). A `propose_patch` whose result fails the **synchronous
semantic phase** (parse, reference resolution, or typecheck — D39) returns a `ValidationReport`
(§2.5) in `structuredContent`: severity, stable `code`, the **CST
node-path** and line/column of the offending span, a human message, and a `suggestion`/`candidates`
fix from the existing `SuggestionEngine` ranking (nearest known parameter; nearest existing
reference of the right category). The agent doesn't get "parse failed" — it gets *"parameter
`roughnes` is not declared on `materials/gold` (line 42); did you mean `roughness`?"* and fixes it.
A stale-precondition commit returns a `CONFLICT` carrying the live `headVersion` ("re-read and
rebase") — never a silent clobber.

**How the agent "sees" the result.** Three observation channels, in increasing richness:

1. **Structural diff** — `read_graph` before/after (or the commit result's `changed[]`) tells the
   agent *what nodes changed* in the derived scene. Cheap, exact, vision-free.
2. **Numeric diagnostics** — `read_diagnostics` gives samples/ETA, the resolved integrator + reason,
   variance/RMSE (when a reference or adaptive sampling exists — never variance alone, per the σ²·T
   "rewards dark images" caveat), and the log tail. This is the **only** channel for a text-only
   local model (it is told it is "flying blind" and leans on numeric convergence + user confirmation).
3. **The image** — `read_image` returns the tone-mapped beauty pass to a vision model. This is the
   differentiator the prior specs identified: a **spectral** renderer converging on "believable
   sunset through the window" by *looking at its own output* — tonal/chromatic correctness that is
   impossible to fake in RGB, so the model can only critique what it can see correctly. The vision
   loop is cost-capped (each iteration is a render): prefer preview-quality + region renders, cache
   the last frame so "look again" without an edit is free.

**Reference-image compare (a Model-B affordance).** Because a scene is a versioned document, the
loop can be closed against a *target*: the agent renders version N, the user (or a `prompts/`
workflow) supplies a reference image, and `read_image?format=exr` + a future per-region variance/RMSE
read-back (the net-new accessor the prior specs flag, SPECTRAL_DIFFERENTIATORS D5) lets the agent
*measure* convergence-to-reference, not just eyeball it. This makes "match this look" a closed
numeric loop, not a vibe.

### 2.4 GUI-as-just-another-agent unification (charter L2) — one mechanism, two clients

This is the architectural payoff and the through-line of the whole redesign. **Both the human GUI
and the agent edit through the same CST-edit pathway (Facet 3).** Concretely:

```
   Human GUI client                     Agent client (in-app or external)

            │  CST + derived graph       │   the agent re-reads rise://cst/*
            └──────────────────────────┘
```

There is **no parallel write path**. A gizmo drag and an agent edit are the same kind of object — a
`CstPatch` committed as a CST version. This is not a slogan; it is the *fix* for the bug class the
editor-state post-mortem documented. That post-mortem found ~17 defects across 8 review rounds, all
four root patterns (P-STATE: "hand-assembled state perpetually incomplete"; P-WALK: "edit handling
duplicated across five parallel walks"; P-INVALIDATE: "invalidation scattered across every mutator")
reducing to one disease — **"state/logic/invalidation replicated instead of owned by one chokepoint."**
Model A had *two* mutable representations (live scene ↔ inverse-edit history) and a *second* implicit
one for the agent; L2 collapses them to **one canonical CST with one apply**. The agent cannot be "a
fresh place to forget a step" because it uses the *same* step the GUI uses. **This is the single
strongest argument for the whole Model-B pivot, and Facet 5 is where it pays off most visibly:** the
agent is not a bolt-on with its own mutation semantics; it is a peer client of the one pathway.

**Human + agent co-editing (turn-taking vs locking vs merge).** Three regimes; the recommendation
is **optimistic concurrency with structural conflict detection, not locking**:

- **v1 — single-writer, optimistic (recommended default).** One *committing* writer at a time: the
  in-app session (human + the in-process agent share the controller and the undo stack) commits
  directly; an **external** agent is **propose-only** — its patch stages as a proposal the in-app
  owner approves (the human sees the agent's diff and clicks Apply, or the agent runs at an autonomy
  level that auto-applies in scope). Every commit carries the `baseHeadVersion` it read at (checked
  against the live `headVersion`, §2.2.1.1); a commit whose precondition lost the race is **rejected
  with a `CONFLICT`** and the loser re-reads + rebases.
  This is exactly a coding agent racing a human in the same file: last-write-*wins* is forbidden;
  the stale writer rebases. (Carried from TRANSACTION_MODEL §4.4, now expressed against CST versions
  rather than Model-A epochs — same contract, cleaner substrate.)
- **v2 — structural three-way merge (the Model-B prize, deferred).** Because the canonical object is
  a CST with **immutable per-node identity** (the `NodeId` lineage, D9/D15) addressed by name-path
  (L5) and formatting-stable serialization (INV-4), two concurrent patches that touch *different
  nodes* can be **merged automatically** (the same way git merges non-overlapping hunks, but at AST
  granularity keyed on NodeId, so it is *semantic* not textual — two edits to `lights/key.power` and
  `materials/gold.roughness` never conflict even if textually adjacent). Only patches touching the
  *same* node conflict, and they conflict *precisely* (the node's identity), not "the file changed."
  (A `rename` is itself a NodeId-preserving op, D9 — it changes a name-path but not the node it
  identifies, which is exactly why merge must key on NodeId, not the mutable name-path; cf. open
  question #1.) This is strictly better than text merge and is uniquely enabled by the lossless-CST
  pivot. Deferred past v1 because it needs Facet 1/3's merge primitive, but it is
  the natural end state and the reason locking is the wrong model.
- **Locking — rejected.** Per-node locks would serialize the human and the agent into a stilted
  turn-taking dance and reintroduce lock-lifetime state (a P-STATE relapse). Optimistic + rebase
  (v1) → structural merge (v2) is the git-native answer and fits the agentic cadence.

**External-file conflict (per [`01-DECISIONS.md`](01-DECISIONS.md) §D6/§D17).** The above governs
*in-process* concurrent writers (CST versions). A distinct hazard is the file changing on disk under
the session — a `git checkout`, another editor, or the CI migrator. The save path records a load/flush
**content fingerprint** — **(size, mtime) as a fast prefilter, upgraded to a content hash** when the
prefilter trips or determinism is required (D17; the same fingerprint definition the AssetManifest
uses, §5) — and the save itself is **atomic**: write a temp file in the target directory → `fsync` →
**revalidate** that the target's current content hash still equals the loaded fingerprint → atomic
`rename()` over the target. If the revalidate finds the on-disk hash moved since load, the flush is
refused and the user/agent is offered reload / diff / force-overwrite — never a silent clobber. (This
replaces D6's looser stat-then-write "compare-and-swap," which had a TOCTOU window; the **documented
residual** is that a non-cooperating concurrent writer can still last-writer-win at the final rename,
for which D17 offers opt-in advisory file locking on shared storage.) A headless agent's natural
answer is to **emit a branch/PR rather than write in place** (§ deployment), turning the conflict
surface into the git-native review flow. (v7 is single-file per §D7, so this is one file per document —
no cross-file atomic-save problem.)

### 2.5 `ValidationReport` — structured errors localized to CST nodes

`validate` (and the pre-commit check inside `propose_patch`) returns:

```jsonc
{ "ok": false, "diagnostics": [
  { "severity": "error", "code": "UNKNOWN_PARAMETER",
    "nodePath": "materials/gold", "chunk": "ggx_material", "parameter": "roughnes",
    "line": 42, "column": 5,
    "message": "Parameter 'roughnes' is not declared on chunk 'ggx_material'.",
    "suggestion": "roughness" },
  { "severity": "error", "code": "UNRESOLVED_REFERENCE",
    "nodePath": "objects/crate.material", "chunk": "standard_object", "parameter": "material",
    "line": 88,
    "message": "References material 'gold' but no material node named 'gold' is defined.",
    "candidates": ["gold_rough", "brass"] } ] }
```

The Model-B addition over the prior design is **`nodePath`** — every diagnostic is anchored to a
**CST node by name-path** (L5), not only a line/column. This matters because (a) the agent edits by
name-path, so an error keyed to a name-path is directly actionable; (b) line/column shift on every
insertion edit, whereas a name-path re-resolves to the same node across such edits (a *rename*
changes it — the durable handle is the node's `NodeId`, D9/D15 — but for the read→validate→fix loop
the name-path the agent just used is the right currency to key the diagnostic on); (c) the GUI binds
the *same* diagnostic
to the *same* widget (the "problems gutter" and the panel field light up together — one report, two
clients, mirroring L2). Stable diagnostic `code`s (machine-matchable): `SYNTAX_ERROR`, `SCENE_VERSION`,
`UNKNOWN_CHUNK`, `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER`, `TYPE_MISMATCH`, `VECTOR_CARDINALITY`, `NON_INTEGER_UINT`,
`ENUM_VALUE_INVALID` (closed enums only), `MISSING_REQUIRED`, `DUPLICATE_NAME`, `UNRESOLVED_REFERENCE`,
`WRONG_PIPE` (the IScalarPainter color-vs-scalar failure), `FILE_NOT_FOUND`, `BARRIER_COMMAND`,
`CONFLICT` (stale precondition), `REDACTED_WHOLESALE_REPLACE`, `DERIVE_FAILED` / `PREPARE_FAILED` (the
**async-phase** failures of a broken-but-valid head — D51). `suggestion`/`candidates` reuse the
`SuggestionEngine` ranking.

**Sync-phase vs async-phase diagnostics (D51).** Most codes above are raised by the **bounded
synchronous semantic phase** (D39) — they block the commit (`propose_patch` refuses, §2.6 #1).
`FILE_NOT_FOUND` is split by depth: a *path that does not resolve* is caught at the sync phase's asset
**identity** check (no bytes loaded — the sync phase does no asset I/O beyond identity, §2.2.4), so it
blocks the commit; an asset that **exists but fails to load/parse/tessellate** is an **async-phase**
failure that does **not** block the (semantic-only, D51) commit and instead surfaces as
`DERIVE_FAILED`/`PREPARE_FAILED` with `status:error` against the published stamp (§2.2.1.1) — the
broken-but-valid-head case. A caller that wants such failures reported *before* the commit is treated as
good uses `propose_patch{ awaitFullValidation: true }` (§2.6 #1).

### 2.6 Agent-edit safety & validation (guardrails)

The safety model is **"the engine, not the model, is the authority"** (AI_SECURITY_MODEL §0), which
survives the pivot wholesale because it never depended on the canonical form. The Model-B-specific
strengthening: validation and atomicity are now *cleaner* because there is one apply.

1. **Every agent edit passes the synchronous semantic phase before it commits (D39) — so commit
   guarantees SEMANTIC validity, NOT full derive/render success (D51).** `propose_patch` runs the
   bounded **sync semantic phase** on the candidate CST — lex → parse → CST → bind-to-descriptor →
   **reference resolution** → type/pipe/typecheck — which catches the parse errors, *unresolved
   references*, and the IScalarPainter color-vs-scalar pipe failures, and **refuses to commit on any
   error**, returning the diagnostics. This gate is **bounded and synchronous** (no realization, TLAS,
   prepare, or render — those are the arbiter's async phase, D34). **D51 corrects the prior "full
   precommit gating" promise (`AI_SECURITY_MODEL.md`):** because the gate is semantic-only, a committed
   head can be a **broken-but-valid CST** — semantically valid yet failing the async expensive phase (a
   missing/changed asset, bad geometry, an integrator that won't prepare). "Does the scene actually
   *build* / realize / load every asset" is therefore verified by the **async expensive phase after the
   cheap commit**, and any failure there surfaces as **`status:error` + node-local `diagnostics` against
   the published stamp** (§2.2.1.1/§2.5) — **never a silent corruption**. The scene is **never left
   half-edited**: an invalid patch (a *semantic* failure) is rejected *before* it touches the canonical
   CST (see #5), and a broken-but-valid commit is a *complete, valid* CST version whose render fails
   loudly. This semantic-only gate is structurally enforced — there is no code path that commits a patch
   that failed the semantic phase. **Opt-in stronger guarantee (D51):** a caller that needs full
   build-validation before treating the commit as good passes **`propose_patch{ awaitFullValidation:
   true }`**, which synchronously **awaits the async derive + prepare (NOT the render)** and reports the
   commit as fully validated (or returns the derive/prepare diagnostics) — the CI/headless posture
   (§2.8); the default stays the fast semantic-only commit that keeps `propose_patch` interactive while
   the heavy realize runs async (open question #2; the explicit design intent of D39).
2. **Partial/invalid edits cannot corrupt the canonical CST (atomic apply).** A patch is
   **all-or-nothing**: the server builds a *candidate* CST off to the side (apply ops / re-parse text),
   validates it, and only on success does it become the new committed version (Facet 3's versioning is
   the commit primitive). A `CstPatch` with five ops where op 3 is invalid commits **zero** ops — not
   two-and-a-half. This is trivial under Model B (the candidate is a separate immutable tree) and was
   *hard* under Model A (a live mutable scene half-mutated mid-apply is exactly the P-WALK hazard).
   Parallel patches in one agent turn are serialized (reject-stale-then-reread) or composed into one
   atomic patch on explicit "apply all" intent — never silent last-write-wins.
3. **Sandboxing destructive ops (always-confirm set).** Independent of autonomy level, a fixed set
   requires a human confirmation **the model cannot satisfy**: `remove`-ing a node, replacing/loading
   a different document, overwriting a file on save/export, enabling an external MCP server, and the
   first cloud egress of new content. L2/L3 drop *per-edit* confirmation for ordinary in-scope edits
   and renders but **never** for this set — an injection can never escalate its own autonomy
   (AI_SECURITY_MODEL §2.2.3, §5). The diff-review gate (L1) is the human firewall: an injected
   "delete all lights" is a red CST diff the user rejects.
4. **No shell, no arbitrary filesystem, no arbitrary network.** The agent operates *RISE*, not the
   machine. There is no run-command tool and no general file read/write; **every file-path argument
   resolves through `ProjectRootJail`** (no model-supplied absolute/`..` paths; Save-As materialized
   only via the human OS dialog), and every outbound URL through `IOutboundUrlPolicy` (SSRF range-block,
   HTTPS-or-loopback, pinned-resolution, redirect re-validation). Untrusted content (scene comments,
   log tails, asset metadata, **external-MCP results**, framebuffer OCR text) is wrapped in
   `<rise:untrusted source=…>` markers — data, never instructions. **All carried verbatim from
   AI_SECURITY_MODEL — orthogonal to Model B, fully retained.**
5. **Secret-byte offset faithfulness (carried).** `read_document`/`read_node` length-preservingly
   mask secrets with a single-byte ASCII mask so the agent's byte offsets equal the canonical
   document's; a whole-document `TextPatch` derived from a redacted read is refused
   (`REDACTED_WHOLESALE_REPLACE`); scoped `CstPatch` ops never touch masked spans. (AI_SECURITY_MODEL
   §3.1; the only adjustment is that "wholesale replace" is now "a whole-document text patch," still
   refused.)

6. **Provenance / attribution of agent vs human edits.** Every CST version records **who authored the
   patch** — `human:gui`, `agent:in-app:<session>`, `agent:external:<client-id>`, `agent:headless` —
   as version metadata (Facet 3 owns the version-history model; this is one field on a commit). The
   payoffs: (a) the GUI's "show me the code" panel and the version timeline label each change by author
   (a human can see "the agent touched these 4 nodes"); (b) git-native review (§2.7) carries authorship
   into the commit trailer (an agent-authored scene change is a reviewable PR with a `Co-Authored-By`
   line, exactly like agent-authored source); (c) undo/blame across the document is author-aware. This
   is strictly richer than Model A's "attributed to originating session" because the attribution rides
   the *version*, which is the canonical thing, not a transient transaction.

### 2.7 Diff-able / git-native / reviewable scenes (the workflows the pivot unlocks)

This is a *product capability*, not a tool, and it is the cleanest dividend of "canonical text."
Because a scene is a **formatting-stable** (INV-4) `.RISEscene` document and the canonical object is
the CST, **a scene change is an ordinary text diff** — and everything git does to text, RISE scenes
inherit for free:

- **PR-review a lighting change.** An agent (or a junior artist) proposes "warm the key light, drop
  exposure ⅓ stop, add a rim." That is a 6-line diff on `lights/key.power`, `lights/key.color`,
  `cameras/hero.exposure`, and a new `lights/rim` chunk. A reviewer reads the diff, sees the rendered
  before/after (CI renders both versions — §7.2), and approves. The review artifact is the *same* CST
  diff the L1 gate shows in-app (one diff representation, every surface).
- **Bisect a regression.** "The render got muddy 30 commits ago." `git bisect` over the scene history,
  re-rendering at each step, pinpoints the exact CST version (and, via provenance §2.6, *who/what*
  made it). This is impossible when the file is a lossy serialization of a mutable model. **The
  bisect is sound because renders are reproducible *within MC tolerance* (D40, weakening D33):**
  `RenderConfig` carries a sampling seed that makes **`prepare` deterministic**, and the same scene
  version at the same effective config + seed re-renders to the **same converged image up to
  Monte-Carlo noise** — so a *visible* tonal/chromatic regression across a bisect step is attributable
  to the CST change, not RNG. This is **review-by-image, not byte-diff**: the bisect compares images
  perceptually (or against a tolerance), because RISE's renderers use per-worker independently-seeded
  RNGs and non-deterministic tile/splat/denoise paths — **bit-identical rendering is a named future**,
  not v1. **Caveat (D28): re-rendering an old version uses *current* asset bytes** — history preserves
  the CST (the source), not the rendered output, so if a referenced texture/mesh/HDRI changed on disk
  since that version, the re-render may differ even though the CST and the seed are identical (see the
  note below).
- **Template / library scenes.** A scene is a program; programs compose. A studio keeps a library of
  reviewed lighting rigs, material packs, camera setups as scene fragments, branches a shot from a
  template, and cherry-picks an approved material change across shots. Declarative iteration (L3 —
  instancers/function-expressions, no `FOR`/`DEFINE` macro-expansion) keeps these fragments
  *parametric and diffable* rather than expanded-and-opaque.
- **Branch a look.** "Try a noir grade" = a branch. Three lighting variants = three branches a
  contact-sheet render compares. The agent's `lighting_variants` prompt becomes *N branches*, each a
  reviewable, mergeable document.

**What history preserves — the CST only (per [`01-DECISIONS.md`](01-DECISIONS.md) §D28).** The
branch/PR flow, `git bisect`, and any "re-derive an old version" path preserve the **CST (the
source)**, **not** the historical rendered output. Re-deriving an old version (`Scene =
f(CST, AssetManifest)`, D5) re-stamps the manifest against the **live filesystem**, so it uses the
**current** asset bytes: if a referenced texture/mesh/HDRI/spectral file changed since that version,
the old version's *render may differ* even though its CST is byte-identical. This is the deliberate
git framing — git versions source while large binary build-inputs are the user's responsibility — and
the `f(CST, AssetManifest)` purity holds *within* a manifest, not across time (where the manifest is
the live filesystem). **Bit-for-bit reproducible historical renders therefore need *two* named
futures** (neither is v1): a **content-addressed asset store** (snapshotting asset bytes by hash — a
git-LFS-style layer at the VCS boundary, D28) so the manifest is reproducible across time, **and
bit-identical rendering** (deterministic per-pixel/per-sample RNG streams, deterministic
splat/denoise — D40) so the render itself is reproducible byte-for-byte. Today the achievable goal is
**review-by-image within MC tolerance** (D40): RISE's history layer stores the CST, an asset CAS (if
it lands) is a separate VCS-boundary feature, and bit-identical rendering is a separate renderer-side
future.

**What makes formatting-stable diffs possible (ties to INV-4, owned by Facet 1):** the lossless CST
round-trips text unchanged, and a structured edit **re-serializes only the touched node's span**,
leaving every other byte (whitespace, comments, ordering) identical. So a one-parameter change is a
**one-line diff**, not a whole-file reflow. Without this, every agent edit would churn the entire file
and diffs would be useless — formatting stability is the load-bearing precondition for the entire
git-native story, which is *why* it is a charter invariant. Facet 5 is the primary consumer; Facet 1
is the guarantor.

### 2.8 Transports & deployment modes

Three transports behind one `AgentTransport` interface (carried from the prior design — the transport
layer is independent of the canonical-form decision):

| Transport | Used by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **In-process** | the in-app chat panel (desktop + Android via JNI) | Shares the address space + the live CST store; lowest latency for the see→edit→render→see loop; the **owner**/committing client by construction. |
| **Loopback HTTP** (127.0.0.1 + per-launch token + `Origin` check) | external clients attaching to a *running* GUI ("Claude Desktop drives my open RISE window") | The only way a second client reaches a running instance; **propose-only** (its patches stage as proposals the owner approves). Android: adb-forwarded loopback only — no same-LAN bind, ever. |
| **stdio** (`rise --agent-stdio scene.RISEscene`) | headless clients that *spawn* RISE (Claude Code, CI, cron) | OS process boundary is the trust boundary; **read+validate only by default**, committing only under an explicit operator launch grant (§7.2). |

**Deployment modes (the charter's explicit ask):**

- **In-GUI embedded agent.** The chat panel is an in-process MCP client; the human and the agent
  co-edit one CST (§2.4). This is the headline product experience and the Android Tier-A surface
  ("talk to your renderer from your phone").
- **Headless / CI / cron agent (respecting the auth caveat).** `rise --agent-stdio` (or the existing
  `printf "render\nquit\n" | rise` extended with an `--agent` mode) is a headless MCP server a script
  or CI job spawns. **The platform caveat from the charter is real and shapes the default:**
  *interactively-authenticated MCP servers (and cloud-LLM credentials) may be absent in headless/cron
  runs.* Therefore:
  - The **safe default headless posture is `read+validate`** — a spawned server can lint/validate/
    derive/render a scene with **no credentials and no autonomy grant**. This is the CI sweet spot:
    "validate every scene in the corpus," "render thumbnails of all branches," "fail the build if any
    scene doesn't derive" — none of which needs an LLM or a cloud key. The *engine-side* tools
    (`validate`, `render`, `read_*`) are useful to a CI pipeline **with no agent at all**. **The
    "fail the build if any scene doesn't *derive*" check is exactly D51's `awaitFullValidation: true`
    mode** — a fast semantic-only commit (the default) catches parse/resolve/typecheck errors, but a CI
    gate that must also catch a missing asset or un-buildable geometry (the broken-but-valid-head case)
    awaits the async derive+prepare via `awaitFullValidation` (still NOT the render). For a *reproducible*
    headless/queued render, a **pinned** render pins its transitive asset closure (D46), so a CI render
    is deterministic regardless of concurrent on-disk asset churn.
  - A headless run that *does* drive an LLM must get its provider key from the environment / a
    secrets manager (never interactive paste), and committing requires `--agent-autonomy=commit`
    (the operator's launch act *is* the owner approval). The always-confirm destructive set still
    fails closed unless a separate explicit headless-destructive grant is given. (Carried from
    MCP_TOOL_SURFACE §4.0 / AI_SECURITY_MODEL §8.1.6.)
- **Local model vs hosted.** A loopback-LLM endpoint (Ollama / LM Studio / llama.cpp at
  `127.0.0.1`) is the **no-egress** path — scenes and framebuffers never leave the machine; the
  egress indicator reads "Local — no data leaves this machine." A hosted provider (Claude / Gemini)
  or a *non-loopback* "local" endpoint is treated as cloud egress (consent + indicator). Vision is
  gated by `supportsVision`; text-only local models degrade the loop to the numeric/structural
  observation channel (§2.3). (Carried from LLM_AGENT_RUNTIME §4.1 — the address class, not the
  label, sets the egress regime.)

### 2.9 Product framing & differentiation — what this makes RISE

**The crisp claim:** RISE is **the only production spectral renderer whose scene is a canonical,
diff-able, version-controllable program — operated by humans and coding agents through the same
read→patch→validate→render→observe loop, with a UI that is a pure projection of that program.**
"OpenSCAD's ergonomics + a real spectral renderer + agent-native," not "Maya with a script console"
(charter §1).

The concrete "nerd" workflows (CLI + agent + git + a dynamic UI), none of which any incumbent offers
as a coherent whole:

- *"Lint my scene in CI."* `rise --agent-stdio --validate scene.RISEscene` → structured diagnostics,
  exit code. No GUI, no LLM, no cloud. (Blender: no canonical text; OpenSCAD: a CSG language, not a
  renderer; Houdini: a binary `.hip`.)
- *"PR-review a lighting change."* The change is a CST diff; CI renders before/after; a reviewer
  approves. Scene review becomes code review.
- *"Get the sunset believable."* An agent runs the vision loop against the *spectral* render until it
  looks right — chromatic correctness an RGB renderer literally cannot judge.
- *"Bisect the regression / branch the look / template the rig."* git, applied to scenes.
- *"Operate my open window from Claude Desktop."* Loopback-HTTP, propose-only, every agent edit a
  reviewable diff and a single undo.

**Where it sits vs the field:**

| Tool | Canonical text? | Real renderer? | Agent-native? | Git-native scenes? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **OpenSCAD** | yes (its language) | no (CSG modeler) | no (no agent loop) | yes (text) |
| **Houdini** | no (binary `.hip`; HDA/VEX are scripting *within* a binary doc) | yes | partial (Python console) | no |
| **Blender + scripts** | no (binary `.blend`; `bpy` mutates a live model = Model A) | yes | partial (bolt-on script console) | no |
| **RISE (Model B)** | **yes (lossless CST)** | **yes (spectral)** | **yes (one read/patch/validate loop)** | **yes (formatting-stable CST diffs)** |

RISE is the only row that is *all four*. The differentiation is not "RISE has an AI feature" — every
DCC is bolting one on. It is that **RISE's canonical representation is the thing agents and git are
already good at**, so the agentic surface is thin, honest, and native rather than a translation layer
over a mutable model. That is a structural moat: a competitor with a binary canonical document cannot
match the diff/branch/review/bisect/CI-lint story without first rebuilding their foundation on text —
which is the Model A→B migration this whole charter is.

## 3. Delete / Evolve / Reuse

Explicit fate of every component this facet touches. The unifying move: **the Model-A "two ways to
persist an edit" (structured-save vs wholesale-rewrite) is deleted; there is one CST patch.**

| Component (today / on-paper) | Fate | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **`apply_scene_text` / "wholesale rewrite + reload" tool** (MCP_TOOL_SURFACE §4.5) | **DELETE** | The Model-A fallback for edits structured-save couldn't represent. Under Model B every edit is a CST patch; a whole-document edit is just a `TextPatch` over the whole span — one more version, not a history-destroying document swap. The tool, the `REDACTED_WHOLESALE_REPLACE` *special-case-for-this-tool*, and the "swap re-roots a fresh UUID / loses undo" semantics all go. (The redaction *refusal* survives, attached to whole-document `TextPatch`.) |
| **The `today(structured)` vs `today(wholesale)` per-tool persistence taxonomy** (MCP_TOOL_SURFACE §4.0 legend, §4.1–§4.5) | **DELETE** | An entire axis of the prior catalog. There is no "this tool persists structurally, that one needs a wholesale reload" — Facet 1's lossless CST makes *every* patch persist structurally by re-serializing only the touched span. "Non-camera creation needs round-trip save" (the prior genuine gap) **evaporates**: creating any node is an `add` CstPatch op, persisted like any other. |
| **The ~25-RPC mutation catalog** (`set_property`, `set_transform`, `apply_material`, `load_hdri`, `add_entity`, `remove_entity`, `clone_entity`, `set_active_camera`, `frame_object`, `set_lens`, `create_camera`, …) | **EVOLVE → collapse into `propose_patch`** | Each becomes a `CstPatch` op (`set`/`add`/`remove`/`rename`) the agent expresses against the document, or a *prompt* that desugars to one. No per-operation schema, no per-operation persistence story. (Convenience: a thin set of named prompts may remain for discoverability.) |
| **`baseEpoch` `(uuidHi, uuidLo, revision)` precondition + the committed/proposed contract + conflict** (MCP_TOOL_SURFACE §4.0/§4-head; TRANSACTION_MODEL §4.4) | **EVOLVE → `baseHeadVersion` over CST versions** | The contract is *right* (optimistic concurrency, no last-write-wins, conflict-on-stale) but re-expressed against Facet 3's CST version identity rather than Model-A transaction epochs, and split into the coherent **`{headVersion, requested/published DerivedStamp + PreparedStamp, status}`** surface (§2.2.1.1, D13/**D29**/**D38**) so a precondition keys on `headVersion` (compared by **DAG ancestry, not numeric `<`**) while derived reads stamp the **`DerivedStamp`** (requested + published) and rendered reads the **`PreparedStamp`** (requested + published), with **`status:ok`/done ⟺ full-stamp equality AND `phase == complete`** (D38/**D49**). The single requested/published stamp surface describes the **preview** (latest-wins, one); **pinned renders are a `RenderJobId`-keyed set with per-job status/control** (D50). Same shape, cleaner substrate. The committed-vs-proposed split (owner commits / external proposes) survives as the v1 concurrency model (§2.4). |
| **`SceneEditController` as "the one mutation path"** | **SUPERSEDE** (Facet 3 owns the replacement) | The prior specs route every tool through `SceneEditController::Commit`. Charter L7 supersedes the `SceneEditor`/`SceneEdit`/`EditHistory`/transaction subsystem with CST versioning. Facet 5 retargets "one mutation path" onto **Facet 3's one CST-edit pathway** — same principle (#6 → INV-6), new mechanism. This facet does not design the edit layer; it consumes it. |
| **`SceneValidator` / `validate` (isolated throwaway `Job`)** (VALIDATION_ARCHITECTURE §3) | **EVOLVE** | Keep `validate` as the keystone; keep "side-effect-free via an isolated derivation, not a mock." But the implementation now rides Facet 1's parser-to-CST + Facet 2's `derive` against a throwaway context, with diagnostics gaining `nodePath` (§2.5). The barrier-command policy (`quit`/`render`/`load`/`run` neutralized; `exit(1)` unreachable) survives. |
| **`SchemaGen` (descriptors → JSON Schema) + `SchemaConformanceTest`** (MCP_TOOL_SURFACE §5; VALIDATION_ARCHITECTURE §5) | **REUSE** | Unchanged by the pivot — descriptors are still the schema (L6). Still a *first-pass filter, not the parser*; still held honest by the conformance test (the generated schema can over-/under-accept vs the tolerant parser). `read_schema` exposes it. |
| **`rise://*` resource catalog** | **EVOLVE → CST-rooted** | `rise://scene/text` → `rise://cst/text`; `rise://scene/chunk/{name}` → `rise://cst/node/{name-path}` (L5). `rise://scene/graph`, `rise://framebuffer`, `rise://render/*`, `rise://log`, `rise://grammar/*` survive with the same contracts. The structured-envelope + single-byte-mask redaction contract survives (offset faithfulness). |
| **The threat model** (AI_SECURITY_MODEL: `ProjectRootJail`, `IOutboundUrlPolicy`, `SecretRedactor`, always-confirm set, loopback-only, untrusted-content quarantine, adb-loopback) | **REUSE wholesale**, except the precommit-gating *promise* (**SUPERSEDE per D51**) | The mitigations are orthogonal to the canonical-form decision and every one holds. Two adjustments: (1) "wholesale replace" is now "whole-document text patch" (still refused when redacted); (2) **AI_SECURITY_MODEL's "full precommit gating" claim is superseded by D51** — commit guarantees **semantic** validity only (parse/resolve/typecheck, D39), **not** full derive/render, so a committed head can be a **broken-but-valid CST** (its async phase fails → `status:error` + node-local diagnostics, never silent corruption; §2.6 #1). The opt-in **`propose_patch{ awaitFullValidation: true }`** restores a build-level guarantee (awaits derive+prepare, not render) for CI/headless callers. The always-confirm destructive set, jail, SSRF policy, redaction, and quarantine are all unchanged. |
| **Transports** (in-process / loopback-HTTP / stdio) + **`ILLMProvider`/adapters/credentials/vision-loop** (LLM_AGENT_RUNTIME) | **REUSE** | Transport and the LLM runtime are independent of the canonical form. Carried forward as designed. (The runtime's "L1 staging = proposed transaction" re-expresses as "proposed CST patch.") |
| **The single `RenderCoordinator`** (RENDER_COORDINATOR.md) | **EVOLVE**, with two rules **SUPERSEDED** for Model B (D47/D48/D50) | Single-render arbitration is retained, but: (1) the coordinator's **"drop all queued/completed jobs on a revision change"** rule is **superseded for pinned renders (D47)** — it applies to **preview** jobs only; pinned jobs survive a head change and run to completion; (2) RISE's **single render slot** is a hard invariant (D48) — while a pinned render owns the slot, **previews SUSPEND/queue, never run alongside** (a routing probe, D45, also takes the slot briefly), and the requester pauses/cancels the pinned render to yield it; (3) pinned renders gain **`RenderJobId`** identity with **per-job** status/result + `stop`/`pause`/`resume` (D50). Preempt/queue/reject semantics otherwise survive; this facet does not re-invent scheduling. |
| **`AsciiCommandParser` headless `> render`/`> load`/`exit(1)`** (`src/RISE/commandconsole.cpp`) | **REUSE + fence** | The existing CLI loop stays for back-compat; the agentic `--agent-stdio` mode fences barrier commands out of any `validate`/agent path (the prior barrier-shim design). |

---

## 4. Hard problems & open questions

1. **Structural three-way merge of CST patches (the v2 prize) is genuinely hard.** AST-granular merge
   keyed on the immutable **NodeId** (D9/D15 — *not* the mutable name-path) is *better* than text merge
   in principle, but defining "do these two patches conflict?" precisely — across `rename` (which moves
   a name-path but preserves the NodeId), declarative-iteration generators (where one logical edit fans
   out to many derived instances, L3), and reference rebinding — is a real research/engineering problem
   owned jointly with Facet 1/3. v1 ships single-writer-optimistic to avoid blocking on it, but the
   product story (§2.7) leans on merge eventually. **Open:** is NodeId disjointness a sufficient
   non-conflict predicate, or do reference edges create hidden conflicts (edit A renames
   `materials/gold`, edit B binds `objects/x.material gold`)?

2. **`validate`/`derive_preview` cost under the agentic cadence (the latency tar-pit, charter's named
   risk).** The loop's value is fast feedback. **D39 resolves the structural part of this question:**
   the pre-commit gate is the **bounded synchronous semantic phase** (lex→parse→CST→reference-resolution
   →typecheck) — explicitly **not** a full derive-dry-run — while the *expensive* phases (realize, TLAS
   rebuild, photon passes, prepare, render) run **off the edit thread on the async, cancellable arbiter**
   (D34), so a successful `propose_patch` *commit* returns immediately. This is exactly the "cheap
   syntax+reference tier gates the common case, full realize is deferred to the async arbiter" split the
   question anticipated, now ratified. **What remains open:** the *latency budget* for that synchronous
   semantic phase on a heavy scene — reference resolution over a large reference graph (and the
   D39-scoped case where a reference reaches into asset-expanded sub-entities, which needs the async
   phase) — and whether even the bounded phase needs incremental caching from Facet 2 to stay
   interactive. (Mirrors the GUI's gutter-vs-deep-validate split.)

3. **Vision-loop economics + reference-compare needs a backing accessor that doesn't exist.** The
   per-region variance/RMSE read-back the reference-compare loop (§2.3) wants is **net-new and not in
   master** (the auto-router's per-pixel `ProbeResult` is private and discarded; SPECTRAL_DIFFERENTIATORS
   D5). Until it ships, "measure convergence to a reference" degrades to whole-frame metrics or eyeballing.
   **Open:** sequence the D5 variance accessor early enough that the headline vision/reference loop is
   real, not aspirational.

4. **How thin is too thin? Discoverability of the patch surface.** A 5-verb surface is elegant, but an
   agent must *discover* that "make the light warmer" = a `set` op on `lights/key.color`. The schema
   (`read_schema`) + the graph (`read_graph`) + prompts carry this, but **open:** do we need a small set
   of *named convenience prompts* (not RPCs) as an affordance/onboarding layer so the model doesn't have
   to reconstruct common operations from first principles every time? (Leaning yes — prompts, which carry
   no authority, are the right place; they desugar to patches.)

5. **Text-patch ↔ CST-patch equivalence at the seams.** Both encodings must converge to the same
   canonical CST (§2.2.2). A `TextPatch` that edits a comment, reorders blocks, or touches whitespace
   has no `CstPatch` equivalent — fine, that's the text encoding's job — but the *diff the L1 gate shows*
   and the *provenance recorded* must be coherent for both. **Open:** when an agent sends a `TextPatch`,
   does the gate show the text diff (faithful to what the agent did) or a re-derived structured diff
   (faithful to the CST delta)? (Leaning: show the text diff for a `TextPatch`, the structured diff for
   a `CstPatch`, since each is what its author actually expressed.)

6. **Headless autonomy + the auth caveat is a sharp edge.** The safe default (read+validate, no creds)
   is clearly right for CI, but the moment a cron job wants an *autonomous* agent loop, it needs a cloud
   key in the environment and `--agent-autonomy=commit` — and the always-confirm destructive set has *no
   human to confirm it*. **Open:** is "fail closed on the destructive set unless a separate explicit
   grant" sufficient, or does headless autonomy need a fundamentally different (e.g. dry-run-only, or
   PR-emitting-not-committing) posture? (Leaning: headless autonomy should **emit a branch/PR**, not
   commit to the working document — turning the auth caveat into a feature: the headless agent proposes,
   a human merges. This makes §2.7's "PR-review a lighting change" the *native* headless mode.)

7. **Multi-document headless server.** A CI job rendering a directory wants one process, many scenes.
   v1 assumes one document per server (simplest). **Open:** multi-document session keying, or
   spawn-per-scene? (Leaning spawn-per-scene for isolation; multi-document is an optimization.)

---

## 5. Cross-facet dependencies & assumptions

What Facet 5 assumes about its neighbors (for synthesis to reconcile):

- **From Facet 1 (CST & scene language):** (a) the lossless CST round-trips text unchanged and a
  structured edit re-serializes **only the touched span** (INV-4) — *the* precondition for the entire
  git-native/diff story (§2.7); without it the agentic surface's headline differentiator collapses.
  (b) **Dual identity** (D9/D15): an **immutable `NodeId`** is the stable *lineage* identity (the
  durable handle an agent holds across edits/renames), and **name-path** (`objects/sphere.material`,
  L5) is the version-resolved *addressing* scheme (changes on rename) — every read tool, every
  `CstPatch` op, and every diagnostic `nodePath` addresses by name-path, while durable cross-turn
  references key on the NodeId Facet 1 exposes. (c) The parser produces the canonical CST from text
  (so a `TextPatch` → re-parse → CST is well-defined). (d) `rename` fixes up referrers from the
  **traced `ReferenceUse` records** (D14 — captures dynamic refs like `timeline.element`), with a
  descriptor-resolver fallback for un-derived subtrees and an explicit flag for any referrer it
  cannot resolve (never a silent dangling rename) — Facet 5 surfaces whatever Facet 1 reports. The
  trace `rename` rewrites from must be **stamped for the exact head** (D25) and must come from the
  **one resolution path — derivation's own resolver, not a separate tracing-pass reimplementation**
  (D35 corrects D25): if the resolved reference set lags head, rename **runs the bounded synchronous
  semantic phase to head** (lex→parse→CST→reference-resolution→typecheck — the *same* phase
  `validate`/precommit use, and the front of the async derive job, so not a second resolver; D39) before
  rewriting referrers — **not** a full async derive — and **refuses** if the semantic phase cannot
  resolve head (a semantic error). Facet 5 never issues a `rename` against a stale trace or a second
  resolver. (D39 scope: references into asset-expanded sub-entities need the async phase and are out of
  v1 cross-reference scope.)
- **From Facet 2 (derivation engine):** (a) **Derivation splits into a bounded synchronous semantic
  phase and an async expensive phase (D39).** The sync phase (lex→parse→CST→bind-to-descriptor→
  reference-resolution→typecheck) is bounded/deterministic/edit-thread-OK and is what `validate`,
  `propose_patch`'s precommit, and `rename` use; it must be **fast enough to gate a `propose_patch`
  interactively** (open question #2). The async phase (realize/tessellate/TLAS/`prepare`/render) is the
  arbiter's cancellable job. The sync phase **is the front of the async job** (same code, same resolver
  — D35's no-drift), so it is not a second resolver. (b) A **throwaway/isolated derivation context**
  exists so `validate`/`derive_preview` have no side effects. (c) `derive` is pure & deterministic
  (INV-2). The `RenderConfig`'s **sampling seed** (D40) replaces `rand()`-seeded stochastic prep so
  **`prepare` (photon maps) is deterministic** — the same `PreparedStamp` yields the same photon maps,
  making the `PreparedArtifact` cache sound; **the final render is NOT bit-identical**, only
  **reproducible within MC tolerance** (per-worker RNGs + `GlobalRNG()` + non-deterministic
  tile/splat/denoise) — bit-identical rendering is a named future, not v1. (c′) **The expensive phase
  runs async + cancellable on the single render arbiter, off the edit thread** (D34) — Facet 5 commits a
  cheap CST version and the arbiter does the heavy work — but **only latest-wins *preview* jobs are
  cancelled by a newer head; stamp-pinned explicit/final renders run to completion** (D43). This is the
  source of the head-vs-published lag. (d) **Two derivation layers with a routing step between them** (D22/D45): a config-**independent**
  `DerivedScene = f(CST, AssetManifest, t)` (what `read_graph` reflects) and a config-**dependent**
  `PreparedRenderState = prepare(DerivedScene, EffectiveRenderConfig)` (light samplers, photon maps —
  what an image reflects), so an integrator override re-runs only route + `prepare`. The `RenderConfig`
  request is resolved by **`ResolveEffectiveRenderConfig(DerivedScene, request)` — run *after* the
  config-independent derive (D45, correcting D42's `(CST, request)`)**: the shipped `auto_rasterizer`
  inspects the assembled `DerivedScene` and **may run a bounded Tier-2 probe render** (taking the single
  render slot briefly, D48) to pick the integrator, so routing cannot resolve from CST text alone — it
  sits between `derive` and `prepare`, and the `DerivedScene` stays config-independent (D22 holds). The
  stamp carries the resolved config's hash + a **view-camera-state hash**, not the raw request or a
  `CameraId` (D42); with the seed (D40) the probe is deterministic, so the resolved config is cacheable
  by (`DerivedScene`-version, request). (d′) **An
  animation frame derives a time-INTERVAL scene** (D31): animated quantities are immutable read-only
  functions over the shutter (per-sample motion blur, no scene mutation), the active **animation name**
  is part of the `DerivedStamp`, and **motion blur is gated v1-off** (single-time in v1; interval scene
  + motion BVH is the named follow-on). (e) **Asset bytes bind by content digest of the
  transitive byte closure; pinned jobs pin the closure** (D41/D46): the `DerivedStamp`'s asset axis is
  `assetDigest` (a content hash of the exact bytes the loader consumed, via load-once-and-hash or
  revalidate-after-load), **not** a session generation counter — so it is a reproducible identity,
  closing the path-hash TOCTOU window. **For a composite asset (D46) the identity is the digest of its
  *transitive byte closure*** — e.g. a glTF's main file **plus** every transitively-referenced external
  buffer/texture (the importer reports its full dependency set, each hashed) — because a digest of the
  direct chunk path alone cannot identify the bytes a glTF render actually consumed. And a **pinned
  render job (D43) pins that entire dependency closure** (the bytes are snapshotted/held for the job's
  lifetime) so a queued/in-flight pinned render reproduces deterministically regardless of later on-disk
  changes — the bounded, per-job version of D28's future content-addressed asset store. (f) **History
  is CST-only** (D28):
  re-deriving an old version re-stamps the `AssetManifest` against the live filesystem (current asset
  bytes), so a reproducible historical render is a future content-addressed-asset-store concern, not a
  derivation guarantee — `f(CST, AssetManifest)` purity holds within a manifest, not across time.
- **From Facet 3 (edit model & history):** (a) **the one CST-edit pathway** both clients commit through
  (L2/INV-6) — Facet 5 is a *client* of it, not its designer. (b) CST **versioning** is the commit
  primitive (atomic apply, the `baseHeadVersion` precondition, conflict-on-stale, undo/redo/branch).
  (c) **Version metadata carries provenance/authorship** (§2.6) — Facet 5 assumes a free-text-ish
  author field on each commit. (d) The eventual **structural merge** primitive (v2, §2.4).
- **From Facet 4 (dynamic UI):** the GUI emits `CstPatch` for its edits and binds widgets + diagnostics
  by name-path — i.e. the GUI is the "human client" of §2.4. Facet 5 and Facet 4 share the L2 mechanism;
  the *only* contract between them is "both emit patches to Facet 3 and re-read from Facet 1/2."

**Conflicts with Locked/Open decisions to flag for synthesis:**

- **No conflict with any Locked decision.** Facet 5 *embodies* L2 (one edit pathway, two clients), L5
  (**charter-corrected by D44: NodeId is the lineage identity, name-path is addressing** — Facet 5
  addresses every read/op/diagnostic by name-path while durable cross-turn references key on NodeId),
  L6 (descriptors are the schema), L7 (supersede `SceneEditController`/`SaveEngine`).
- **O1 (lossless-CST vs pure-text-canonical):** Facet 5 designs for lossless-CST-pivot. **If the reviewer
  chose pure-text-canonical instead,** the delta is *small and favorable* for this facet: the two patch
  encodings collapse toward one (text is the canonical thing; a `CstPatch` becomes sugar that the server
  expands to a text edit), `read_node`-by-name-path needs a text-span index over the buffer (Facet 1
  provides it either way), and provenance/diffs are *more* trivially git-native (the buffer *is* the
  artifact). The agentic surface is arguably *simpler* under text-canonical; this facet does not depend
  on the CST being the canonical object, only on (i) formatting-stable diffs and (ii) name-path
  addressing — both of which either model provides.
- **O2 (debounced-commit vs 60Hz):** Facet 5 assumes debounced-commit, which matches the agentic
  edit→preview cadence perfectly (an agent doesn't drag a slider at 60Hz). No delta for the agent path.

---

## 6. First-slice implications (the minimal end-to-end vertical)

The charter's first slice is **one chunk type, text⟷CST⟷derived-scene, one schema-generated widget,
live incremental re-derive.** Facet 5's contribution to that vertical — the smallest agentic surface
that proves the whole thesis end-to-end:

1. **`read_schema` for the one chunk** — `SchemaGen` emits the JSON Schema for that one chunk's
   descriptor (L6). Proves the agent can learn the grammar from the source of truth.
2. **`read_document` + `read_node`** — return the canonical CST text and the one node by name-path
   (with the redaction envelope). Proves read + stable addressing.
3. **`validate`** — re-parse a candidate text/patch → a `ValidationReport` with a `nodePath`-anchored
   diagnostic (the `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER` → "did you mean…" case is the canonical demo). This is the
   single highest-leverage net-new piece and the keystone of the loop; build it first.
4. **`propose_patch` (structured, `set` op only)** — change the one chunk's one parameter, validated,
   committed as a new CST version through **Facet 3's edit pathway** (the *same* call the Facet-4 widget
   makes — proving L2 with one mechanism, two clients, in the first slice).
5. **`render` + `read_image`** — submit a render of the derived scene, read back the framebuffer.
   Closes the observe end of the loop (vision optional in slice 0 — `read_diagnostics` text suffices).

That is the entire coding-agent loop — **read → validate → patch → derive → render → observe** — over a
single chunk, sharing one edit pathway with the GUI widget, with the agent's view generated from the
descriptor. It demonstrates the product thesis (canonical, diff-able, agent-operated, dynamic-UI) in
miniature, and every piece is small: `SchemaGen` (filter), `validate` (the one genuinely new pass),
and a JSON-RPC adapter over Facets 1–3. Transports for slice 0: **in-process** (proves the in-app
agent) + **stdio** (proves headless `rise --agent-stdio` validate/render, which needs no LLM and no
credentials — the CI sweet spot, and the cheapest way to exercise the surface in tests).

## 7. Appendix — quick reference

### 7.1 The whole mutating surface (vs the Model-A catalog)

```
Model B (this doc):                          Model A (docs/gui/, superseded):
  propose_patch  (CstPatch | TextPatch;        set_property, set_transform, apply_material,
                  awaitFullValidation? — D51)  load_hdri, add_entity, remove_entity,
  validate                                     clone_entity, set_active_camera, frame_object,
  render → RenderJobId when pinned (D50)       set_lens, create_camera, apply_scene_text,
  stop / pause / resume  ({job?} — per-job)    save_scene, load_scene, export_image, …
  derive_preview                             + the same read_* / render_* tools
  + read_* (document/node/graph/             + the structured-vs-wholesale persistence axis
    schema/image/diagnostics)                  (DELETED — one CST patch persists everything)
```
Notes: `propose_patch` commit is **semantic-only** (D39/D51) — `awaitFullValidation:true` awaits
async derive+prepare (not render). An explicit **`render{pinned:true}` returns a `RenderJobId`**;
`stop`/`pause`/`resume` take an optional `{job}` and target that pinned job (else the latest-wins
preview, D48/D50). One render slot; previews suspend while a pinned render owns it (D48).

### 7.2 CI lint/render recipe (no LLM, no cloud, no GUI)

```sh
# Lint every scene in a corpus — fast SEMANTIC validation (parse/resolve/typecheck, D39):
rise --agent-stdio --validate scenes/**/*.RISEscene

# Stronger CI gate — also fail if a scene won't DERIVE/PREPARE (missing asset, bad geometry —
# the broken-but-valid-head case, D51): awaits async derive+prepare, NOT the render.
rise --agent-stdio --validate --await-full-validation scenes/**/*.RISEscene

# Render before/after for a PR-reviewed lighting change (the §2.7 workflow):
# --pinned so the render owns the single slot to completion and pins its asset closure (D46/D48):
git checkout main      && rise --agent-stdio --render --pinned hero.RISEscene -o before.exr
git checkout feature   && rise --agent-stdio --render --pinned hero.RISEscene -o after.exr
# CI posts before/after to the PR; reviewer approves the CST diff (review-by-image within MC tolerance).
```

These use only the **engine-side** tools (`validate`, `render`, `read_*`) — the agentic surface is
useful to a pipeline *with no agent at all*, which is the cleanest proof that the foundation, not a
bolted-on LLM, is the product.
