# RISE correctness debt ledger

One verified list of the correctness debts genuinely still open in RISE,
produced by re-checking every heading in `CLOTH_FABRIC_DESIGN.md` §15,
`WETNESS_COAT_DESIGN.md` §12, `GEOMETRY_SHADING_SIGNALS_DESIGN.md` §14,
`SIGNALS_UNDER_BIDIRECTIONAL_TRANSPORT.md` §10,
`CROSS_OBJECT_PROXIMITY_DESIGN.md` §10, `RENDERING_INTEGRATORS.md` §7 (debts
27-31), `REFRACTIVE_RADIANCE_SCALING.md` §10, and `IMPROVEMENTS.md` against
the code and tests in this tree (debt-sweep worktree, HEAD `14bc2cb6`, dated
2026-09-12). Every verdict below is cited to a file:symbol, test, or commit —
no verdict is taken on the source document's word alone for anything marked
OPEN.

Sorted by class (physics-bias/energy-loss, precision, API/bridge gap,
coverage/test gap, doc-rot), S before M before L within a class. Struck
headings in the source ledgers point back to the row here (or vice versa)
that closed them.

| DL-03 | RENDERING_INTEGRATORS.md debt 31 item 1 / REFRACTIVE_RADIANCE_SCALING.md §10.3 | Path-guiding substitutes a direction at `TranslucentSPF`'s exit lobe without carrying its popped `ior_stack`; the translucent object silently stays on the IOR stack, later hits misclassify entering/exiting | OPEN-confirmed | `TranslucentSPF.cpp` ~line 305-307/438-440 (`front.ior_stack->pop()`); `PathTracingIntegrator.cpp` ~3205/3260 sets `traceIorStack = &iorStack` (pre-scatter stack); `BDPTIntegrator.cpp:161`/`PathTracingIntegrator.cpp:553` `GuidingSupportsSurfaceSampling` admits `eRayDiffuse` unconditionally, confirmed by reading all four sites this sweep | M | physics-bias | user-visible (path guiding + `translucent_material` only) |
| DL-04 | REFRACTIVE_RADIANCE_SCALING.md §10.1 | Whether `SubSurfaceScatteringSPF`/`RandomWalkSSS`/`BSSRDFSampling::Sw` correctly omit the debt-30 eta^2 factor (telescoping argument) or need it (PBRT-style eta^2 divide) is undecided; direction not pinned down | OPEN-confirmed | Doc's own two-reading analysis (§10.1(a)/(b)); the disambiguating render (matched dielectric-shell-with-medium vs `subsurfacescattering_material`, submerged vs air camera) has not been produced — confirmed absent from `tests/` this sweep | M | physics-bias | user-visible (SSS in non-air medium only) |
| DL-05 | CLOTH_FABRIC_DESIGN.md §15 item 27 | Two-layer gapped weave with the light outside: PT under-reads BDPT/VCM by 1.28-1.55x because PT's binary NEE cannot see through the far layer's delta gap lobe; single layer or light inside is exact | OPEN-confirmed | Doc's own measured table (box/planes, gap 0.1/0.3); mechanism traced to `CastShadowRayTransmittance` (`RayCaster.cpp` ~1980) being gated to perfect-specular dielectrics only, confirmed present as described this sweep | L | physics-bias | user-visible |
| DL-06 | IMPROVEMENTS.md §"VCM env-IBL" (Session 9-13) / CLAUDE.md "Env-IBL deficit" entry | VCM env+mesh strict-tolerance residual (env-S0 <-> env-NEE MIS partition violation) — Session 13 explicitly decided to STOP and accept the disc-area baseline rather than fix it; `plank_closeup`'s VCM 0.55x (RENDERING_INTEGRATORS.md debt 28) is the same known bias class, not a new bug | OPEN-confirmed (deprioritized, not fixed) | `docs/VCM_ENV_MIS_PARTITION_INVESTIGATION.md` "Session 13 outcome"; `IMPROVEMENTS.md` lines ~1030-1046; still true in this tree — no VCM env-branch SA-MIS migration commit exists (`git log --oneline -- src/Library/Shaders/VCMIntegrator.cpp` shows no such commit after Session 13) | L | physics-bias | user-visible |
| DL-07 | CLOTH_FABRIC_DESIGN.md §15 item 17 / WETNESS_COAT_DESIGN.md §12 item 13 | `OrenNayarBRDF::hemisphericalAlbedo` over-estimates (measured ~12.6% high at roughness 0.5, ~25.6% at 1.0), which over-amplifies `fabric_material`'s energy-subtraction and `coated_material`'s Saunderson recycling denominator; not fixable in either wrapper, needs its own bake | OPEN-confirmed | `OrenNayarBRDF.cpp:148-190`'s own doc comment states the bias and that "no clean closed form exists to correct it with"; unchanged this sweep | L | physics-bias | user-visible (rough Oren-Nayar under fabric/coat) |
| DL-08 | RENDERING_INTEGRATORS.md debt 29 | `PSSMLTSampler`'s 49-lane stream layout is exceeded by `BDPTIntegrator`'s eye-subpath walk (`StartStream(16u+depth)`) at eye/volume depth >= 32, aliasing MLT's own film/lens/aperture lanes on stream 48 | OPEN-confirmed | `BDPTIntegrator.cpp:1732`; `PSSMLTSampler.cpp:59,75,146-147` (`kNumStreams` default 49, `idx = streamIndex + kNumStreams*sampleIndex`), read directly this sweep; `maxVolumeBounce` default 64 reaches depth 32 in ordinary deep-volume scenes | L | physics-bias | user-visible (MLT + deep volume/eye recursion) |
| DL-09 | REFRACTIVE_RADIANCE_SCALING.md §10.2 | `RadianceEtaScale` reads the IOR stack's push/pop-time values while `DielectricSPF`/`PerfectRefractorSPF` re-fetch the `ior` painter fresh at each hit; for a spatially-varying `ior` these can differ at an interior vertex (NEE/bounce before exit) | OPEN-confirmed, unexercised | `IORStack.h`'s `RadianceEtaScale` doc comment; confirmed no scene or test in the tree binds a spatially-varying `IScalarPainter` to `ior` (`grep -rl 'ior.*scalar_painter'` scenes/ tests/ empty) this sweep | S | precision | internal (no scene exercises it yet) |
| DL-10 | RENDERING_INTEGRATORS.md debt 28 (fisheye residual) | Fisheye camera's per-pixel solid angle is computed in the pre-stretch local frame while `mxTrans` applies `Stretch(pixelAR,1,1)`; at `pixelAR != 1` the world-space solid angle differs by an uncomputed direction-dependent Jacobian | OPEN-confirmed, unexercised | Doc's own analysis; confirmed no in-tree scene pairs `fisheye_camera` with non-square `pixelAR` (`grep -rl fisheye_camera scenes/` cross-checked against pixelAR values) this sweep | S | precision | internal (no scene exercises it yet) |
| DL-11 | CLOTH_FABRIC_DESIGN.md §15 item 18 | Sheen directional-albedo table's middle band (`kMinSheenAlpha` <= n·v < 0.0349) still reads +0.75% over 1 after the round-9 64x64 rebake; the bottleneck moved (α ≈ 0.065 roughness-floor mechanism), not closed, and root-cause work is unstarted | OPEN-confirmed | Doc's own round-9 table; `tests/SheenDirectionalAlbedoTest.cpp` and `tests/LayeredWhiteFurnaceTest.cpp` grazing-check both still assert the *bounded*, not *exact*, posture (checked this sweep — no round-10 commit exists) | M | precision | user-visible (subtle, grazing sheen) |
| DL-12 | CLOTH_FABRIC_DESIGN.md §15 item 15 | Mirrored UV seams flip weave direction: `vShadingTangent` has no `bitangentSign` companion, so a `dpdu`-derived tangent can mirror across a UV seam | OPEN-confirmed | `RayIntersectionGeometric.h:296-299` (`vTangent`'s handling) vs `:344-345` (`vShadingTangent`, no sign field), confirmed absent this sweep | M | precision | user-visible (mirrored-UV mesh + weave) |
| DL-13 | GEOMETRY_SHADING_SIGNALS_DESIGN.md §14 item 3 | Displaced geometry curvature is ambiguous between base (`smoothing=1`) and displaced (`smoothing=0`) surface; only `EllipsoidGeometry`/`DisplacedGeometry` override `ComputeAnalyticalDerivatives` at all, and lookdev often wants base curvature the baked path can't isolate tessellation-independently | OPEN-confirmed | `DisplacedGeometry.cpp:407+`; confirmed no third override or documented convention added since this heading was written | M | precision | user-visible (wear/relief masks on displaced meshes) |
| DL-14 | SIGNALS_UNDER_BIDIRECTIONAL_TRANSPORT.md §10 | Ray differentials (`fw`/`fwo`) are 0 under BDPT/VCM/MLT (no differentials plumbed for those walks), a PT-vs-bidirectional difference on filtered-noise / footprint-driven bands | OPEN-confirmed | Doc's own §10 residual list; confirmed no `BDPTVertex` differential field exists (`grep -n differentials src/Library/Shaders/BDPTIntegrator.h` finds the S1 signals/derivatives widening but no ray-footprint differential) this sweep | M | precision | user-visible (footprint-aware texture filtering under BDPT/VCM/MLT) |
| DL-15 | CROSS_OBJECT_PROXIMITY_DESIGN.md §10 | An eccentric ellipsoid neighbour's distance bound is loose by its semi-axis ratio (4:1 measured: true distance 2.75 reported as 11.0), so `proximity(r)` silently paints nothing unless the author inflates the radius by the ratio | OPEN-confirmed | Doc's own measured example; Phase 3 (shipped 2026-09-09) makes σ exact but "`x sigma_max` remains a bound attained only along the top singular vector" — confirmed the bound, not exactness, is what Phase 3 delivered, by re-reading §10's Phase-3 paragraph this sweep | M | precision | user-visible (unpainted seam near eccentric ellipsoids) |
| DL-16 | CLOTH_FABRIC_DESIGN.md §15 item 4 | `ggx_material.tangent_rotation` stays Color-pipe only; the promised Scalar-pipe alias (so a `fabric_material`'s `weave_rotation` and its substrate's own rotation can share one painter) was never added | OPEN-confirmed | `ChunkParserRegistry.cpp:4495` — `tangent_rotation`'s only descriptor entry is `ParameterPipe::Color`, `p.description` states "a scalar_painter does NOT bind here"; no second `tangent_rotation`-family scalar parameter exists (grepped this sweep) | S | API/bridge gap | user-visible (authoring: can't drive both rotations from one field) |
| DL-17 | CLOTH_FABRIC_DESIGN.md §15 item 12 | glTF `anisotropy_rotation` is still dropped at import, even though the expression VM's `atan2` (confirmed present) makes the sketched fix executable today | OPEN-confirmed | `GLTFSceneImporter.cpp:1300-1307`'s comment stands; `ChunkParserRegistry.cpp:4560`'s `anisotropy_rotation` descriptor still reads "Phase 1 reads but does not yet APPLY the rotation" — read directly this sweep | S | API/bridge gap | user-visible (glTF import only) |
| DL-18 | CLOTH_FABRIC_DESIGN.md §15 item 13 | The Blender bridge has no sheen, anisotropic, or velvet mapping at all — Principled's Sheen sockets have no `fabric_material` target | OPEN-confirmed | No `fabric_material`/`sheen` reference found in the Blender bridge sources this sweep (`grep -rl fabric_material` under the Blender add-on tree returns nothing) | M | API/bridge gap | user-visible (Blender-authored scenes only) |
| DL-19 | SIGNALS_UNDER_BIDIRECTIONAL_TRANSPORT.md §10 | Two S3 conversion sites (BDPT's NM-hero `Le` rebuild, the HWSS companion `rigW` rebuild) share the signals-replay helper but have no dedicated red-proof — their contribution is MIS-weighted to a few percent on the money test's scenes, so skipping them moves the suite by <= 5.7% / 0% | OPEN-confirmed (test gap) | Doc's own §10 disclosure, confirmed current (no new red-proof test added for these two sites since — `tests/SignalEmitterRecordTest.cpp` unchanged in this tree per `git log` this sweep) | S | coverage/test gap | internal (test-suite blind spot) |
| DL-20 | GEOMETRY_SHADING_SIGNALS_DESIGN.md §14 item 2 | Patch geometries report flat curvature (`valid=false`) while genuinely curved; deferred to Phase 4, no Phase-4 work has landed | OPEN-confirmed | No patch-geometry curvature override exists (only `EllipsoidGeometry`/`DisplacedGeometry` override `ComputeAnalyticalDerivatives`, confirmed this sweep alongside DL-13) | M | coverage/test gap | user-visible (curvature-driven wear on patch geometry reads absent, not wrong) |
| DL-21 | GEOMETRY_SHADING_SIGNALS_DESIGN.md §14 item 5 | CSG boundary curvature behaviour is unspecified/undecided (forward the contributing surface's curvature, or invalidate at the seam) | OPEN-confirmed | `tests/CsgSurfacePayloadTest.cpp:833-834` exercises the derivative fields there but does not pin a curvature convention at the boundary — confirmed by reading the referenced lines this sweep | M | coverage/test gap | user-visible (CSG seam wear masks) |
| DL-22 | SIGNALS_UNDER_BIDIRECTIONAL_TRANSPORT.md §10 | BSSRDF entry vertices read default (neutral) `derivatives`/`signals` under both PT and BDPT — integrator-consistent, but a signal-keyed IOR/Fresnel painter at a subsurface entry point is neutral rather than live | OPEN-confirmed | Doc's own §10 first bullet; closing it needs a probe record in `BSSRDFSampling::SampleResult`, confirmed absent this sweep | M | coverage/test gap | user-visible (signal-keyed SSS entry only) |

## Not-a-debt (design choices / observed-need gates / declined) — reviewed, no action

- CLOTH_FABRIC_DESIGN.md §15 item 5 — anisotropic Charlie sheen deferred; design choice, LTC route noted if ever needed.
- CLOTH_FABRIC_DESIGN.md §15 item 6 — Ashikhmin-Premoze-Shirley velvet normalization unverified; not implemented, not blocking.
- CLOTH_FABRIC_DESIGN.md §15 item 8 / GEOMETRY_SHADING_SIGNALS_DESIGN.md §14 item 8 — `ScalarToPainterAdapter` doesn't exist; convenience gap, explicitly "not a blocker" in both docs.
- CLOTH_FABRIC_DESIGN.md §15 item 10 — weave aliasing has no automatic mitigation; authoring idiom (`fw` fade), not a defect.
- CLOTH_FABRIC_DESIGN.md §15 item 11 — multi-slot preset hypothesis unmeasured; unbuilt feature, not a defect.
- CLOTH_FABRIC_DESIGN.md §15 item 14 — Tier-1 spectral dye not attempted; future opportunity, non-goal-adjacent.
- CLOTH_FABRIC_DESIGN.md §15 item 16 — `fabric_material`'s own `hemisphericalAlbedo` factorization is closed-form and measured <= 0.64%; the larger residual is DL-07 (Oren-Nayar's own bug), not this item.
- GEOMETRY_SHADING_SIGNALS_DESIGN.md §14 item 4 — vertex-normal quality is loader-dependent; documented limitation, no fix proposed, none needed.
- GEOMETRY_SHADING_SIGNALS_DESIGN.md §14 item 7 — `expression_function2d` stays UV-only by design.
- CROSS_OBJECT_PROXIMITY_DESIGN.md §10 — non-convex coplanar clipped-plane refusal: safe-by-design (refusing rather than under-reporting).
- CROSS_OBJECT_PROXIMITY_DESIGN.md §10 — emissive objects never count toward proximity: Phase-3-gated on observed need, not a defect.
- CROSS_OBJECT_PROXIMITY_DESIGN.md §10 — `kL1Ways` cliff: superseded by Phase 3 S4 (8 ways, measured 0.8967->0.8968 hit rate), closed in-doc already.
- IMPROVEMENTS.md §8B/§8C (correlation-aware / efficiency-aware MIS for BDPT), §7D (deferred null-scattering volume item) — roadmap features explicitly marked deferred, not correctness bugs.

## Verification recipes for OPEN items

Concrete "how to know it's fixed" for each DL-xx row above.

**DL-01 (TranslucentSPF RGB/NM exit weight divergence).** Extend
`tests/TranslucentIORStackTest.cpp` (or add
`tests/TranslucentSpectralParityTest.cpp`) with a `translucent_material`
fixture (`transmittance 0.4`, uniform per-channel `N`), render/evaluate the
exit lobe once through the RGB path and once through `ScatterNM` at a fixed
wavelength set. Expected today: NM exit reads ~0.4x the RGB exit (a `~2.5x`
disagreement, matching the doc's own figure). Fixed when both read the same
value to the suite's `CROSS_VAL_TOL` (1e-3), after deciding which
convention (extinction-only, or extinction*transmittance) is correct and
applying it to both `Scatter` and `ScatterNM`.

**DL-02 (TranslucentSPF spectral exit MIS inconsistency).** In the same
test file, sample `ScatterNM`'s exit lobe N times, and independently compute
`PdfNM` for each sampled direction. Expected today: `PdfNM` returns the
cosine density while the Phong-lobe density the sample was actually drawn
from differs measurably at grazing directions. Fixed when a pointwise
`kray*pdf == value*|cos|`-style check (the existing `SPFBSDFConsistencyTest`
convention) passes for the exit lobe at the shared `CROSS_VAL_TOL`.

**DL-03 (TranslucentSPF guided-direction IOR-stack leak).** Add a scene with
path guiding enabled (`use_path_guiding true`, enough samples to train the
field) and a `translucent_material` object; after a training pass, verify
via a counter/log line in `PathTracingIntegrator` that when the guided field
intercepts a translucent exit vertex, the substituted ray still uses the
SPF's `pS->ior_stack` (post-pop) rather than the pre-scatter `iorStack`.
Fixed when a later hit on the same object after a guided exit reads
`bEntering == true`, not `false`; a red-proof test should assert on the
`IORStack::containsCurrent()` state after a guided translucent exit.

**DL-04 (SSS family eta^2 direction).** Build the two-material observable
the doc names: a semi-infinite slab as (a) a `dielectric_material` shell
with a scattering interior medium, and (b) `subsurfacescattering_material`
with matched albedo/mfp, each rendered with a submerged camera and an
air camera, everything else fixed. Expected invariant if RISE's convention
is self-consistent: the submerged/air brightness ratio is identical for (a)
and (b). A `tests/SSSRadianceScalingTest.cpp` asserting that ratio-of-ratios
== 1 (within MC noise) is the closing guard, however the underlying
direction resolves.

**DL-05 (PT two-layer weave gap, debt 27).** Extend
`tests/BDPTStrategyBalanceTest.cpp` with a topology pairing two
`weave_material transmission thin` layers with a light OUTSIDE both (the
doc's own box/plane fixtures at gap 0.1/0.3). Expected today: PT/BDPT ~=
0.65-0.78 (i.e. BDPT/PT 1.28-1.55x). Fixed when a `HasNonBendingDeltaLobe()`
material query lets `CastShadowRayTransmittance` (or an equivalent walk)
see through the far layer's delta gap for PT's NEE, closing the row to the
suite's standard 8% band, with an added-energy suppression against PT's
own BSDF-sampled delta continuation for AREA lights (to avoid a new
double-count).

**DL-06 (VCM env+mesh SA-MIS partition).** Re-run `EnvLightBalanceTest` at
its strict tolerances (`{0.10, 0.30, 1.00}`); currently 78/80. Fixed when
the monolithic SA-MIS migration (both subpath sides, the shared generator's
env-vertex pdf convention, the 6 BDPT rows, OpenPGL) lands and this reaches
80/80 strict without regressing hwss=true below ~0.82 (its pre-existing,
separately-tracked bias floor).

**DL-07 (OrenNayarBRDF hemisphericalAlbedo bias).** Add a
`tests/OrenNayarHemisphericalAlbedoTest.cpp` comparing
`OrenNayarBRDF::hemisphericalAlbedo()`'s closed form against a brute-force
hemispherical quadrature at roughness in {0, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0}. Expected today:
0% / ~5% / ~12.6% / ~25.6% over. Fixed when a corrected estimator (or a
small baked correction table) brings all four under a stated tolerance
(e.g. 2%), then re-measure `fabric_material`/`coated_material`'s furnace
configs that depend on it (cloth furnace config using Oren-Nayar substrate;
`WETNESS_COAT_DESIGN.md`'s coated-Oren-Nayar furnace row).

**DL-08 (PSSMLT stream aliasing).** Add a case to
`tests/PSSMLTStreamAliasingTest.cpp` that drives a volume-heavy scene to eye
depth >= 32 under `mlt_spectral_rasterizer` (or the RGB MLT rasterizer) and
asserts that stream indices used by the eye walk never collide with
stream 48's film/lens/aperture lanes (e.g. by instrumenting
`PSSMLTSampler::StartStream` to log/assert on `streamIndex >= kNumStreams`
distinctness, or by comparing rendered means with `kNumStreams` raised well
past 32 vs the shipped 49). Fixed when either `kNumStreams` is raised past
any reachable depth or the eye walk's stream assignment is reworked to stay
bounded, and the new test passes where it previously would have aliased.

**DL-09 (RadianceEtaScale spatially-varying ior).** Author a scene with a
graded-index object (`ior` bound to a spatially-varying `scalar_painter`)
and an NEE connection or bounce gathered at an interior vertex. Compare
against a reference computed by an independent means (e.g. a fine-grained
multi-shell approximation with piecewise-uniform `ior`). This is presently
unbuilt — the recipe is to build `tests/RadianceEtaScaleGradedIndexTest.cpp`
first, establish whether the mismatch is measurable, then decide whether
`RadianceEtaScale` needs to read the SPF's freshly-fetched value instead of
the stack's push/pop-time one.

**DL-10 (fisheye pixelAR Jacobian).** Author a fisheye-camera scene with
`pixelAR != 1` and a uniform-radiance sphere filling the frame (the same
fixture `tests/CameraImportanceTest.cpp::TestFisheyeFilmResponse` uses at
`pixelAR = 1`, where it integrates to 1.000166). Expected: at `pixelAR !=
1` the closed-form integral departs from 1 by more than measurement noise.
Fixed when `Importance`'s per-pixel solid-angle term folds in the full
Jacobian of `normalize ∘ Stretch(pixelAR,1,1)` and the extended test
converges to 1 at several `pixelAR` values.

**DL-11 (sheen middle-band residual).** Re-run
`tests/SheenDirectionalAlbedoTest.cpp`'s domination-slack check at the
current 64x64 table; currently the middle band (n·v in [kMinSheenAlpha,
0.0349)) reads +0.75% over 1. Fixed when a root-caused correction near the
roughness floor (α ≈ 0.065) brings that band under the same ~0.2% bar the
other two bands already clear, without another blind resolution doubling.

**DL-12 (mirrored UV weave direction).** Add a mirrored-UV mesh fixture to
`tests/WeaveMaterialChunkTest.cpp` (or a render regression under
`scenes/Tests/`) and compare the weave direction rendered across the seam
against an authored `TANGENT`-accessor re-export. Fixed when a
`bitangentSign` companion on `vShadingTangent` recovers the chirality
`vTangent` already has (`RayIntersectionGeometric.h:296-299` vs `:344-345`)
and the mirrored half no longer flips weave direction.

**DL-13 (displaced-geometry curvature ambiguity).** Add a
`tests/GeometryCurvatureConventionTest.cpp` case comparing `curv` on a
`displaced_geometry` at `smoothing=0` vs `smoothing=1` against the two
closed-form curvatures (base sphere/plane vs the displaced analytic
surface, using `ComputeAnalyticalDerivatives`). This is a documentation
decision as much as a code one: fixed when the descriptor states which
curvature `smoothing` selects and a test pins both numerically.

**DL-14 (ray differentials 0 under BDPT/VCM/MLT).** Extend
`tests/BDPTVertexRIGRebuildTest.cpp` (or a new
`tests/BDPTRayDifferentialsTest.cpp`) asserting `fw`/`fwo` are populated (not
0) on a `BDPTVertex` in a scene using footprint-driven texture filtering.
Fixed when differentials are plumbed through the BDPT/VCM/MLT walk (mirroring
the S1 `derivatives`/`signals` widening already done) and the PT-vs-BDPT
filtered-band difference shrinks to noise on a control scene.

**DL-15 (eccentric ellipsoid proximity bound).** Extend
`tests/CrossObjectProximityTest.cpp` with a 4:1 eccentric ellipsoid and a
probe point at true distance 2.75; assert the reported distance against a
tighter, non-uniform bound (or at minimum that the current ~11.0 reading is
logged/warned per-object as the doc's "quantifies per object" note
promises). Fixed when Phase 3's exact-σ work is extended to report a
tighter bound along more than the single top singular vector, or an
explicit per-object inflation warning is emitted at scene-load time.

**DL-16 (ggx_material tangent_rotation scalar-pipe alias).** Add
`tangent_rotation_scalar` (or an equivalent accept-either-pipe resolution
order) to `ggx_material`'s descriptor in `ChunkParserRegistry.cpp`,
preferring Scalar and keeping the Color binding working-but-deprecated.
Fixed when a `tests/ChunkParserRegistryTest.cpp`-style case binds a
`scalar_painter` to the new slot and a `fabric_material` wrapping the same
GGX base can drive both rotations from one shared painter, matching the
already-shipped `weave_rotation`/`tangent_rotation` additive convention.

**DL-17 (glTF anisotropy_rotation).** Implement the sketch in
`CLOTH_FABRIC_DESIGN.md` §15 item 12 (two `channel_painter`s + an `atan2`
`scalar_painter` bound to `weave_rotation`) in `GLTFSceneImporter.cpp`.
Fixed when a glTF fixture with a per-texel anisotropy rotation texture
imports and renders a spatially-varying anisotropic highlight, verified in
`tests/GLTFClearcoatImportTest.cpp` or a new anisotropy-rotation sibling.

**DL-18 (Blender bridge sheen mapping).** Add Principled BSDF Sheen socket
import to the Blender bridge, targeting `fabric_material`. Fixed when a
round-trip test (Blender fixture -> RISE scene -> render) shows a non-zero
sheen contribution matching the authored Sheen weight/tint within the
bridge's existing tolerance conventions.

**DL-19 (S3 sites without a red-proof).** Build a light-tracing-dominated
spectral scene (a caustic through glass, or an emitter reachable only by
t=1 splats) and add it to `tests/SignalEmitterRecordTest.cpp`. Fixed when
that scene's BDPT NM-hero `Le` rebuild and HWSS `rigW` rebuild sites move
the suite's numbers by more than a few percent when their signal-replay is
disabled — i.e., a real red-proof exists where none did.

**DL-20 (patch geometry flat curvature).** This is a Phase-4 scope item, not
a bug in the current `valid=false` contract. Fixed when Phase 4 adds a
`curv` implementation for patch geometries and a
`tests/PatchCurvatureTest.cpp` compares it against an analytic patch
curvature at a few parametric points.

**DL-21 (CSG boundary curvature).** Add a case to
`tests/CsgSurfacePayloadTest.cpp` at a CSG boundary edge asserting a chosen
convention (forward the contributing surface's curvature, most likely) and
pin the number. Fixed when that assertion exists and passes.

**DL-22 (BSSRDF entry vertex neutral signals).** Add a probe record to
`BSSRDFSampling::SampleResult` carrying `derivatives`/`signals` at the
entry hit, and extend `tests/SignalIntegratorConsistencyTest.cpp` with an
SSS-entry scene keyed on a geometry signal (e.g. `curv`-driven IOR). Fixed
when that scene's PT and BDPT/VCM renders agree with the closed-form
control the way the other five signal kinds already do post-S1/S3.
