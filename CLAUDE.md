# RISE Claude Companion

This file intentionally stays thin so it does not drift from the shared docs. Start with [README.md](README.md) for the repo map, [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the shared agent guide, and [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for deep dives.

## Quickstart

- Main build: `make -C build/make/rise -j8 all`
- Tests: `make -C build/make/rise tests` then `./run_all_tests.sh`
- Header-only changes: run `make -C build/make/rise clean` before rebuilding because header dependencies are not tracked reliably
- Sample render:

```sh
export RISE_MEDIA_PATH="$(pwd)/"
printf "render\nquit\n" | ./bin/rise scenes/Tests/Geometry/shapes.RISEscene
```

## High-Value Facts

- Public construction API: [src/Library/RISE_API.h](src/Library/RISE_API.h)
- High-level construction interface: [src/Library/Interfaces/IJob.h](src/Library/Interfaces/IJob.h)
- Main assembly implementation: [src/Library/Job.cpp](src/Library/Job.cpp)
- Parser source of truth: [src/Library/Parsers/AsciiSceneParser.cpp](src/Library/Parsers/AsciiSceneParser.cpp)
- Render-pass entry point: [src/Library/Rendering/PixelBasedRasterizerHelper.cpp](src/Library/Rendering/PixelBasedRasterizerHelper.cpp)
- Scene files expect `RISE ASCII SCENE 5`, and chunk braces must be on their own lines
- `Job::InitializeContainers()` creates the `Scene`, named managers, `"none"` defaults, and default shader ops
- `Job::SetPrimaryAcceleration()` replaces the object manager and discards previously added objects
- Named managers plus explicit reference counting are foundational; inspect [src/Library/Managers/GenericManager.h](src/Library/Managers/GenericManager.h) and [src/Library/Utilities/Reference.h](src/Library/Utilities/Reference.h) before changing lifetimes
- Tests are standalone executables, not a unit-test framework suite
- The logger defaults to `RISELog.txt`, but the main CLI overrides it to `RISE_Log.txt` in the working directory
